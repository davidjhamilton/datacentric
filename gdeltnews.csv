For Petty Officer 3rd Class Denim Kurtis, law enforcement is a family affair. His mother is a deputy sheriff, and his father-in-law is an investigator for the San Francisco district attorney’s office.
So when Kurtis felt the call to serve his country, the Coast Guard’s maritime enforcement specialty was a natural fit. He initially joined as a reservist at a San Francisco-based port security unit before integrating into the active duty force almost three years ago. Today the San Jose, California, native serves aboard U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Bertholf (WMSL 750) , operating in the Western Pacific.
“I honestly enjoy it quite a bit,” Kurtis says of his duties aboard the 418-foot national security cutter .
Whether those duties include drug interdiction in the Caribbean or Eastern Pacific Ocean or enforcing United Nations sanctions in the Western Pacific, Kurtis – one of two maritime enforcement specialists assigned to the ship – stays busy.
“The best part of my job is teaching maritime law enforcement to my shipmates, and making them as excited about our job as I am,” Kurtis says. “Also, being able to see different parts of the world, in areas I never thought to travel, has been eye-opening and a life-changing experience, in itself.”
Kurtis takes particular pride in keeping drugs out of the United States as part of the ship’s counter-narcotics missions.
“It’s an all-encompassing task when you’re out there,” Kurtis said. “We do it all, from gathering intelligence to the actual enforcement, then detention and offload” of seized illegal drugs. “It’s great to see it loaded off the boat and destroyed by the Drug Enforcement Administration.”
His supervisor, Petty Officer 1st Class Jon-Paul Smith, said Kurtis sets an excellent example for more junior service members.
“He’s a very outgoing individual,” Smith said. “He presents himself well, and he’s used to presenting on a level that is definitely higher than his paygrade.”
Smith said Kurtis has explained Bertholf’s law enforcement missions – and the Coast Guard’s – to large groups of foreign dignitaries and American congressional leaders. In addition, he takes a leading role in Bertholf’s law enforcement boardings, including one noteworthy search of a suspicious fishing vessel during which Kurtis located a large quantity of cocaine in a fish hold. The seizure became part of more than 3,000 kilograms of cocaine, worth more than $107 million, seized by Bertholf during a recent patrol in support of the Joint Inter-Agency Task Force off Central America.
Kurtis says each bale of cocaine the ship seizes when it is out to sea makes America a better, safer place.
“How many lives of families and police officers are improved by not having contact with those drugs?” he asks. “How many kids’ homes aren’t being destroyed?”
Those intangibles may be hard to measure, but the quantity of drugs seized by the Coast Guard’s national security cutters is not. In fiscal year 2017, the Coast Guard and its partner agencies intercepted 455,000 pounds of cocaine before it got to American shores. Of that amount, more than one-third was seized by national security cutters such as Bertholf. The total street value of the cocaine was more than $6 billion.
Kurtis, who is married with a two-year-old son and another child on the way, says it’s hard to leave family behind for the demanding deployments his job has required. Mission success makes the separation worthwhile, he says, but he also is looking forward to his next duty station, a shore-based unit in San Francisco.
“Some days I felt like the day would never come,” he says of the approaching end of his time on Bertholf. “And other days I really don’t want it to come.”

This was Munro’s first counter-drug patrol since its commissioning in 2017, and resulted in drug seizures onboard five “panga” style vessels, one low-profile go-fast vessel, one fishing vessel, and one self-propelled semi-submersible vessel.  The interdiction of the self-propelled semi-submersible on June 18th resulted in the removal of over 17000 pounds of cocaine, worth an estimated $232 million, making it the Coast Guard’s largest single seizure since 2015. The eight interdictions resulted in the total seizure of more than 31,000 pounds of illicit narcotics worth an estimated $467 million in wholesale value.  During the patrol, Munro’s crew conducted over 230 flight evolutions with an embarked helicopter from the Coast Guard’s Helicopter Interdiction Tactical Squadron (HITRON), which specializes in providing airborne use of force during maritime drug interdiction efforts.  Munro’s embarked HITRON team utilized disabling fire on the outboard engines of two fleeing suspect vessels, allowing the cutter’s boarding teams to gain positive control. This was HITRON’s most successful deployment since the unit’s inception twenty years ago.  “I’m incredibly proud of this crew and their accomplishments,” said MUNRO’s Commanding Officer, Capt. James Estramonte. “The success of this patrol is a testament to their hard work and dedication. As they spend some well-deserved down time with their families, they can rest assured that they’ve made a difference by preventing this poison from reaching our streets, and that they’ve taken some of the profits out of the pockets of international drug cartels.”  The Munro offloaded the contraband, along with 8000 pounds of drugs seized by two other Coast Guard cutters, last Thursday in San Diego. The total amount offload was over 39,000 pounds of cocaine and 933 pounds of marijuana, worth an estimated $569 million.  Vice President Pence, James W. Carroll, director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, DEA acting administrator Uttam Dhillon, and Vice Adm. Linda Fagan, commander of Coast Guard Pacific Area, attended the event and gave remarks to the crew and media.  “Our men and women on the frontlines face the highest levels of cocaine cultivation and smuggling ever, and the mission of our Coast Guard crews is fraught with challenge,” said Fagan.  70% of the Coast Guard’s offshore presence is the service’s aging fleet of medium endurance cutters, many of which are over 50 years old, Fagan noted. “In order to maximize effectiveness, their replacements, the Offshore Patrol Cutters, must feature the same advanced capabilities that national security cutters like Munro have utilized to be so successful.”  The Munro is the sixth of the Coast Guard’s legend class national security cutters. National security cutters feature advanced command-and-control capabilities, aviation support facilities, stern cutter boat launch and increased endurance for long-range patrols to disrupt threats to national security further offshore.

By: Leo Shane III  To help combat drug smugglers on the high seas, Pence pointed to recent and robust budgets for the Coast Guard.  “We are committed to fully funding our Coast Guard and replacing old ship with new ones, just like the U.S. Coast Guard cutter Munro,” he said. “Get ready, more help is on the way.”  Homeported in Alameda, California, the $487 million Legend-class Munro was commissioned two years ago.  That’s decades younger than the Famous-class cutter Mohawk and the Reliance-class cutter Vigorous that joined its counter-narcotics operations from homeports in Virginia Beach and Key West.

U.S. Coast Guard
U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Munro crew members board a semi-submersible suspected of carrying drugs on June 18 while operating in international waters of the Eastern Pacific Ocean.
U.S. Coast Guard
A high-speed chase involving a suspected narco-submarine out in the eastern Pacific Ocean offers a look into just how dangerous the U.S. Coast Guard's operations to combat drug smuggling can be.
The dramatic, one-minute video was recorded by a member of the Coast Guard wearing a helmet camera on June 18. It was released on Thursday.
""Stop your boat!"" a Coast Guard member's voice can be heard repeatedly shouting in Spanish.
But the self-propelled, semi-submersible speeds ahead in the international waters of the Pacific. ""That's going to be hard to get on,"" the man says.
The U.S. Coast Guard cutter Munro gets closer to the vessel, and a person is able to climb aboard and pound on the vessel's hatch. A suspected drug smuggler emerges, hands in the air.
That's where the footage stops.
The craft was reportedly holding more than 17,000 pounds of cocaine, valued at about $232 million, according to The Washington Post .
Such vessels are built to evade detection while holding large amounts of illegal imports, the Coast Guard said in a description accompanying the video .
""They're like the White Whale,"" Lt. Cmdr. Stephen Brickey told the newspaper. ""They're pretty rare. For us to get one, it's a significant event.""
That's because smugglers often will open a valve and purposefully sink their vessels to avoid seizure, dispersing evidence of suspected crimes into the ocean. Brickey told the Post that law enforcement often has just one or two minutes to evaluate whether a vessel they boarded is heading to the ocean floor.
Federal Agents Seize Cargo Ship Linked To Massive Cocaine Bust In Philadelphia
A Coast Guard aircraft initially spotted the semi-submersible and then two boats stealthily approached, CNN reported . It added that all five people on the seized vessel were handed over to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.
Vice President Pence attended an offloading event Thursday at Naval Air Station North Island in San Diego involving 39,000 pounds of cocaine and 933 pounds of marijuana seized from suspected drug smugglers in the Eastern Pacific, including the cocaine from the semi-submersible.
Those drugs — worth some $569 million — were seized by three Coast Guard cutters in busts between May and July.

Incredible moment Coast Guard busts alleged drug sub at sea
The U.S. Coast guard has released video showing a dramatic, high speed ocean chase that ended with the capture of a purpose-built semi-submersible allegedly carrying a large amount of cocaine.

Remarkable vision has emerged of the moment a United States Coast Guard crew chase down a submarine running drugs in the Pacific Ocean and leap on top of it.
The Cutter Munro was on patrol in international waters off the coast of South America on June 18 when they intercepted the self-propelled semi-submersible, commonly known as a “narco sub”.
America’s Defence Department released video of the crew chasing the submarine at high speed as it bobbed just above the waterline, large swells crashing against it.
The crew scream in Spanish: “Stop your boat now.”

A crew member jumps on top of the sub and manages to make his way to the hatch, bashing on it repeatedly. A trafficker eventually opens it with his hands raised.
A whopping 6.9 tonnes of cocaine was found on board, worth an estimated $US232 million ($A332). It was seized before the Coast Guard sunk the vessel.
A number of men were detained and will be prosecuted in the US.
During its three months at sea, the Cutter Munro conducted 14 intercepts, which netted an additional 17 tonnes of cocaine and 420 kilograms of marijuana.
Submarines are regularly used by traffickers because they are hard to detect, can travel long distances and are able to carry significant quantities of drugs on board.

In today’s increasingly global world, understanding diverse cultures and embracing differences is essential to success. Given the challenges and far-reaching missions of the Coast Guard, wise cadets seek to strengthen their understanding of other cultures and faiths, while growing in their own tradition. As a result, they better understand themselves, those with whom they serve, as well as the public they will encounter.
But what happens when you are the only one like you, past and present?
Coast Guard Academy First Class Cadet Stephanie Miranda is a first generation Indian-American, the only cadet of Indian heritage at the Academy, and believed to be the first Indian-American woman to graduate from the Academy.
“My country is America, I am an American,” said Miranda. “But I am also Indian.”
Miranda, coming to the Academy for Swab Summer in 2014, quickly realized that she was the only cadet of Indian heritage and has been for her four years here.
“When I first got here, I noticed that there were not any other Indian looking cadets here,” said Miranda. “I have kept my eye open for another, but in the four years I have been here, I have not met another.”

Miranda is a success story of the Academy’s Minority Outreach Team, which works to recruit cadets of diverse backgrounds.
Founded in 2009, the AMOT augments recruiting and retention efforts of applicants, prep school scholars, and Coast Guard Academy cadets of color. Most team members are either Academy graduates or active duty officers from diverse backgrounds who have been paired with individual cadets of similar backgrounds.
Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Hoon Park is one of the AMOT leaders for Asian-American cadets.
“Miranda is a great cadet and a value to the Academy,” said Park. “She has shared her culture and heritage with many others giving us a better understanding of what it means to be an Indian-American. We believe that she is the first Indian-American woman to graduate from the Academy and on a year with the largest amount of Asian-Americans graduating.”
Growing up, Miranda was surrounded by family with strong ties in the Indian community.
“We are Indians, we have customs different from others,” said Miranda. “One of our customs is to bring others into our homes and make them feel welcome. I have brought this with me to the Academy.”
Being the only Indian at the Academy, Miranda is asked to share her culture and traditions by others.
“She shares the food her grandma and aunt make with me,” said First Class Cadet Victoria Nelson, Miranda’s roommate. “I enjoy hearing about how the food is made and why she likes it so much.”
Food is how Miranda gets others interested in Indian culture and traditions.
“Everyone loves food, and Indian food is the best there is,” said Miranda.
Nelson, the president of the Academy’s Asian Pacific American Council teamed up with Miranda to host a Holi event as one of the group’s lunch excusals.
Holi is popularly known as the Indian “festival of spring” and signifies the arrival of spring, the end of winter, the blossoming of love, and for many a festive day to meet others, play and laugh, forget and forgive, and repair broken relationships.
“By introducing others to Indian food it gives me the opportunity to introduce them to more Indian culture,” said Miranda. “Bhindi Masala, also known as okra stir-fry, is my favorite.”
The Coast Guard Academy gives Miranda more opportunities than sharing food and culture, it gives her the opportunity to belong and make a difference.
Early in her life, Miranda knew she wanted to pursue a career in law enforcement.
“I have always been interested in helping people,” said Miranda. “The Coast Guard’s mission allows me to help people through law enforcement.”

Being the only one who looks like you is tough for anyone, but Miranda doesn’t feel that way. She is grateful for the opportunities here at the Academy and her future in the Coast Guard.
“When people think Indian, they automatically think Hindu is my religion, but both my parents are Roman Catholic and that is how I was raised,” said Miranda. “Being Roman Catholic in the States and at the Academy is not a big deal, but in India it is. I would be excluded from participating in many events and some colleges because of my religion.”
Many people in India believe in the caste system, where people are separated into rigid hierarchical groups based on their work, social status and religion.
“Here at the Academy I am given the same opportunities as everyone else,” said Miranda. “Here, I am included.”
Being included however, does not lessen Miranda’s Indian culture homesickness.
“My parents live in California on the other side of the country, but luckily my aunt lives in New York and I am able to visit her often,” said Miranda.
“I am able to visit with my family in New York, eat Indian food, and participate in Indian cultural events.”
Most of Miranda’s mother’s family moved from India to Canada and then into New York. Her parents met in New York and then moved to California where her father finished his degree in engineering and started a career with Apple.
“My parents are amazing,” said Miranda. “They are both so smart and have supported me in everything I have [chosen] to do including joining the Coast Guard. My whole family is very supportive”
With some family still in India, Miranda has visited the country several times.
“India is the most beautiful place on Earth,” said Miranda. “I enjoy going there and immersing in the culture and the beauty of it all. The Taj Mahal is my favorite place to visit.”
This year, Miranda will start a new journey as a Coast Guard ensign aboard the Coast Guard Cutter Mackinaw, homeported in Cheboygan, Michigan.
“I am very excited to start my career and serve on the most amazing cutter,” said Miranda. “The ‘Queen of the Lakes’ has the most complex missions in the Coast Guard, from ice breaking to law enforcement to humanitarian to public affairs.
“I am so excited for my next journey and to introduce the crew of the Mackinaw to some chicken tikka masala and mango curry.”

Media: US Coast Guard  The semisubmersible filled with thousands of pounds of cocaine tore through deep Pacific waters, ultimately bound for the United States, tracked by a Coast Guard surveillance aircraft.  Infamously elusive boats dubbed narco-submarines - cartel-funded ships built in the jungle to haul massive amounts of drugs - have bedeviled Coast Guardsmen tasked with stemming the flow of contraband. Most are never spotted.  But on June 18, there was a positive hit on a narco-submarine hundreds of miles off the Colombian and Ecuadoran coast in waters patrolled by the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Munro. The ship deployed a boarding team on two small boats with a helicopter watching overhead.

Guardsmen, trained in boarding ships, wore helmet camera videos recording the moment they ran down the vessel. ""Stop your boat! Now!"" one roars in Spanish as waves crash against the hull. ""That's going to be hard to get on,"" he says. The boarders wore holstered pistols and night-vision goggles to prepare to peer inside the dark hull.  Three Guardsmen slip off the side of their boat onto the 40-foot narco-sub as one boarder pounds on the hatch with his fist. Then, a suspected trafficker emerges and puts his hands up as the Coast Guardsmen scream commands. Then the video ends.  Inside was more than 17,000 pounds of cocaine, estimated to be worth $232 million, said Lt. Commander Stephen Brickey, a spokesman for U.S. Coast Guard Pacific Area.  ""They're like the White Whale,"" Brickey told The Washington Post on Thursday, describing narco-subs. ""They're pretty rare. For us to get one, it's a significant event."" The Pacific region monitored by the Coast Guard is about the size of the continental U.S., Brickey said, likening the mission to a pair of police cars patrolling the country.  Brickey said patrols may encounter a narco-sub once a year or so. Boarding them can be ""hairy,"" he said - smugglers can be armed, and when caught, they typically open a valve to quickly fill the vessel with water, sending all the drugs and evidence to the ocean floor.  Boarders have one to two minutes to assess whether they are on a drug-laced vessel about to sink, Brickey said.  This particular semisubmersible - a ship partially submerged that cannot fully dive like a submarine - was sunk by the Coast Guard, Brickey said. The alleged smugglers were taken for prosecution by the DEA.  The haul from the June seizure was set to be offloaded Thursday during an event with Vice President Mike Pence in attendance, part of 14 separate seizures of drugs worth a combined $569 million, the Coast Guard said. The seizures occurred off the coasts of Mexico, Central America and South America.  About 80% of drugs that enter the U.S. come from the Pacific corridor, Brickey said, and authorities stop about 11% of semisubmersibles. In 2009, The Washington Post reported that more than a third of Colombian cocaine that ultimately arrived in the U.S. was smuggled into submersibles bound for Central America and Mexico. Recent News

Brianna Grisell)  BOSTON — The crew of Coast Guard Cutter Escanaba returned to Boston Thursday following a three-month patrol conducting drug and migrant interdiction operations in the Caribbean Sea.  Throughout the patrol, Escanaba’s crew focused their efforts on law enforcement, completed a three-week training assessment of mission capabilities in Portsmouth, Virginia, and held a change-of-command ceremony.  Escanaba’s crew partnered with Customs and Border Patrol within the Mona Passage for migrant interdiction operations. Crews terminated three illegal migrant ventures and repatriated more than 100 migrants.  The crew’s counter-narcotics efforts resulted in the disruption of more than 5,500 pounds of cocaine illegally trafficked by transnational criminal organizations.  During Escanaba’s change-of-command ceremony, Cmdr. Michael Nalli relieved Capt. Michael Turdo as commanding officer.  “It is an honor and privilege to serve as the commanding officer of such a capable ship,” said Nalli. “The crew is well trained and we are excited to get underway to conduct the missions of the Coast Guard.”  Coast Guard Cutter Escanaba, known as “The Pride of Boston”, is a 270-foot Medium Endurance Cutter with a crew complement of 100.

The dramatic, one-minute video was recorded by a member of the Coast Guard wearing a helmet camera on June 18. It was released on Thursday.  ""Stop your boat!"" a Coast Guard member's voice can be heard repeatedly shouting in Spanish.  But the self-propelled, semi-submersible speeds ahead in the international waters of the Pacific. ""That's going to be hard to get on,"" the man says.  The U.S. Coast Guard cutter Munro gets closer to the vessel, and a person is able to climb aboard and pound on the vessel's hatch. A suspected drug smuggler emerges, hands in the air.  That's where the footage stops.  The craft was reportedly holding more than 17,000 pounds of cocaine, valued at about $232 million, according to The Washington Post .  Such vessels are built to evade detection while holding large amounts of illegal imports, the Coast Guard said in a description accompanying the video .  ""They're like the White Whale,"" Lt. Cmdr. Stephen Brickey told the newspaper. ""They're pretty rare. For us to get one, it's a significant event.""  That's because smugglers often will open a valve and purposefully sink their vessels to avoid seizure, dispersing evidence of suspected crimes into the ocean. Brickey told the Post that law enforcement often has just one or two minutes to evaluate whether a vessel they boarded is heading to the ocean floor.  A Coast Guard aircraft initially spotted the semi-submersible and then two boats stealthily approached, CNN reported . It added that all five people on the seized vessel were handed over to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.  Vice President Pence attended an offloading event Thursday at Naval Air Station North Island in San Diego involving 39,000 pounds of cocaine and 933 pounds of marijuana seized from suspected drug smugglers in the Eastern Pacific, including the cocaine from the semi-submersible.  Those drugs — worth some $569 million — were seized by three Coast Guard cutters in busts between May and July. Copyright 2019 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org .

Five people who were stranded Friday on a vessel that had run aground in the Gulf of Mexico were rescued by the Coast Guard as Tropical Storm Barry intensified.  Watchstanders at Coast Guard Sector Mobile received a distress call over around 9:45 a.m. about 20 nautical miles southwest of Gulfport, Coast Guard officials said in a news release.  A MH-65 Dolphin helicopter aircrew from Coast Guard Air Station New Orleans was deployed to assist the mariners.

The passengers were recovered in stable condition.   Coast Guard officials are encouraging boaters to stay off the water as Tropical Storm Barry makes its way through the Gulf of Mexico.  ""Hurricanes and tropical storms can be deadly and our ability to conduct rescues can be diminished or nonexistent at the height of a storm,"" officials said in news release. ""Be prepared, stay informed and heed storm warnings.""  Coast Guard officials said boaters and coastal residents should monitor the progress and strength of the storm through local television, radio and the Internet. Boaters can monitor its progress on VHF radio channel 16. Information can also be obtained on small craft advisories and warnings on VHF radio channel 16.

The Coast Guard rescued a total of 12 people stranded or in need of emergency help as Tropical Storm Barry swept through Terrebonne Parish.  Eleven residents and two pets were evacuated from Isle de Jean Charles Saturday morning along with one resident experiencing a medical emergency in the Dulac area, a Coast Guard spokesperson said.  The Isle de Jean Charles residents were evacuated by Coast Guard helicopters and taken to the Houma-Terrebonne Airport. A response boat was dispatched from Morgan City but ultimately not used during the rescue operations.  Initial reports came in around 4:30 a.m. of people in distress along Island Road, the only way in and out of Isle de Jean Charles, a Coast Guard spokesperson said.  The Terrebonne Parish Sheriff’s Office initially planned to dispatch its Water Patrol but called the Coast Guard for assistance because weather conditions were too dangerous.  “We dispatched a Water Patrol agent so that a rescue by boat could be done,” Sheriff Jerry Larpenter said. “With the weather conditions at that time, particularly in darkness, the risk for that plan was too great both for deputies and for the people they would rescue.”  Initial reports stated five houses along the island were underwater, a Coast Guard spokesperson said.  Island Road remained entirely underwater Saturday. The area was included in a voluntary evacuation order issued by the parish.  As the storm continued to progress, Larpenter and Coast Guard Rear Adm. Paul Thomas urged residents to pay attention to local officials’ warning and take the storm seriously.  “We have a good working relationship with the Coast Guard, which makes this kind of cooperative effort possible,” Larpenter said.  “The longer someone waits the more the lives of their potential rescuers are put in danger, as well as their own,” Larpenter said. “I’m glad everybody ended up safe. But, this community’s residents are well aware that they are vulnerable to strong south winds, let alone a tropical system. Yet these individuals waited until the very last minute to call for help, rather than make plans to leave well before, when two Coast Guard helicopters and our boats would not have been necessary.”  With the medical emergency in Dulac, a 77-year-old man was evacuated by helicopter to the Houma airport and brought to an area hospital, Thomas said. He is now in stable condition, a Coast Guard spokesperson said.  “First, take this storm seriously. Our capabilities deteriorate as conditions deteriorate. Hang on and we’ll get there as soon as we can,” Thomas said from a news conference in New Orleans.  “Though we are the best, in some conditions its not safe to put air and boat crews in jeopardy,” he said. “As the storm moves north, we will come in from the south.”  If an emergency situation does arise, the best way to get help is by calling 911, Thomas said. Even calling the Coast Guard directly is not the best way to get emergency help.  While the storm made landfall Saturday afternoon, personnel were preparing for the long haul, he said.  About 20 aircraft crews and 30 boat teams are staged around south Louisiana ready to respond when needed. Many of those are the same response teams that moved in after Hurricane Harvey, Thomas said.

Most are never spotted, and for years before one was seized, they were dubbed “Bigfoot” — the stuff of rumor and legend.  But on June 18, there was a positive hit on a narco-submarine hundreds of miles off the Colombian and Ecuadoran coast in waters patrolled by the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Munro. The ship deployed a boarding team on two small boats with a helicopter watching overhead.  Guardsmen, trained in boarding ships, wore helmet cameras recording the moment they ran down the vessel. “Stop your boat! Now!” one roars in Spanish as waves crash against the hull. “That’s going to be hard to get on,” he says. The boarders wore holstered pistols and night-vision goggles to prepare to peer inside the dark hull.

U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Munro crew members inspect a self-propelled semi-submersible on June 19. (U.S. Coast Guard)  Inside was more than 17,000 pounds of cocaine worth an estimated $232 million, said Lt. Cmdr. Stephen Brickey, a spokesman for U.S. Coast Guard Pacific Area.  “They’re like the White Whale,” Brickey told The Washington Post on Thursday, describing narco-subs. “They’re pretty rare. For us to get one, it’s a significant event.”  The Pacific region monitored by the Coast Guard is about the size of the continental United States, Brickey said, likening the mission to a pair of police cars patrolling the country.  Brickey said patrols may encounter a narco-sub once a year or so. Boarding them can be “hairy,” he said — smugglers can be armed, and when caught, they typically open a valve to quickly fill the vessel with water, sending all the drugs and evidence to the ocean floor.  Boarders have one to two minutes to assess if they are on a drug-laced vessel about to sink, Brickey said.  This particular semi-submersible — a ship partially submerged that cannot fully dive like a submarine — was sunk by the Coast Guard, Brickey said. The alleged smugglers were taken for prosecution by the DEA.  The haul from the June seizure was set to be offloaded Thursday during an event with Vice President Pence in attendance, part of 14 separate seizures of drugs worth a combined $569 million, the Coast Guard said.

(U.S. Coast Guard)  About 80 percent of drugs that enter the United States come from the Pacific corridor, Brickey said, and authorities stop around 11 percent of semi-submersibles. In 2009, The Post reported that more than a third of Colombian cocaine that ultimately arrived in the United States was smuggled into submersibles bound for Central America and Mexico.  Read more:

In the video from June 18, members of the team are seen pounding on the hatch until one of the suspected smugglers emerges with his hands up. According to the Coast Guard, the vessel was seized by crew from the Coast Guard Cutter Munro.  The drugs seized during the dramatic boarding are among the estimated $569 million in drugs seized from the Pacific that were offloaded Thursday in San Diego, according to Coast Guard officials. In total, the Coast Guard seized 39 tons of cocaine and nearly 1,000 pounds of marijuana from drug smuggling vessels in the Eastern Pacific between May and July of this year.  Vice President Mike Pence attended the offloading of the drugs Thursday. In a speech, Pence praised the Coast Guard's work, saying, ""Make no mistake about it, Coasties, your courageous service is saving American lives."" Trending News

According to the release, ""The drugs represent 14 separate suspected drug smuggling vessel interdictions and disruptions off the coasts of Mexico, Central and South America by three Coast Guard cutters between May and July 2019.""  In a press briefing Thursday, Special Agent James Spero of U.S. Homeland Security Investigations announced that 55 suspected smugglers had been detained along with the drugs that were seized. He added that the seizures were a part of Operation Panama Express, a multiagency effort to stem the drug flow into the U.S. Most of the cocaine and marijuana offloaded Thursday will be used as evidence for investigations in Tampa.  Although the boats and submarines interdicted were in international waters, Spero noted that law enforcement is able to inspect the vessels because they ""are not flying a country's flag.""  The drug and vessel seizures are only the beginning of a long investigation, according to Spero. After the suspected smugglers onboard the vessels are detained and interviewed, the multiagency task force starts developing ""second-tier targets -- those responsible for the shipment and the building of the boats"" with the ultimate goal of ""dismantling the organization.""  When asked if the seizures were unusual, Spero said that ""homemade"" submarine seizures are ""not all that unusual,"" and added that the Coast Guard ""sees this amount of drugs every couple of months.""

The US Coast Guard said it had received notification regarding a disabled vessel with more than 20 people aboard, 130 miles north-east of Jacksonville, Florida.  “The crew of the Coast Guard cutter Seneca was diverted to the scene and interdicted 22 Haitian migrants, 17 males, four females and one child, due to safety concerns with the vessel,” the Coast Guard said.  It said that last Saturday another notification was received, indicating that a 24-foot wooden rustic vessel was found 27 miles south of Key West, Florida.  The Coast Guard said that 33 Cuban migrants, including 27 males were detained as a result.  “The Coast Guard continues to maintain a focused and coordinated effort with multiple agency assets to interdict any attempt to dangerously and unlawfully immigrate by sea to the United States,” said Commander Michael Vega, Coast Guard 7th District enforcement branch.  “Those who are interdicted at sea attempting to illegally immigrate will be repatriated to their country in accordance with existing US immigration policy,” he added.  The US Coast Guard said about 3,027 Haitian migrants have attempted to illegally enter the US since the start of the year, compared to 2,727 Haitian migrants last year.

MIAMI — The search continued Friday morning for a 37-year-old man who fell overboard from the cruise ship Carnival Victory.  Crew members aboard the Coast Guard Cutter Charles Sexton searched throughout  the night, according to Petty Officer 3rd Class Brandon Murray. A Coast Guard Air Station Miami HC-144 Ocean Sentry airplane rejoined the search at daylight Friday.  Coast Guard 7th District watchstanders received a report Thursday from the Carnival Victory that a crew member had fallen overboard about 30 miles northwest of Cuba.  Both the HC-144 and the cutter Charles Sexton searched the area Thursday.  According to Carnival's website, the Victory is based out of Miami.

Other incidents aboard cruise ships  In December, an  autistic man disappeared from a Carnival cruise ship after climbing a railing along the side of the vessel and went overboard, according to Carnival.  More:    Autistic man who went overboard on Carnival ship may have wanted to swim, family says  The incident took place on the 2,052-passenger Carnival Fantasy, which was on a five-night cruise out of Mobile, Alabama. The vessel was in the Gulf of Mexico at the time.  The reason the man — identified by his family as 22-year-old Luke Renner of Johns Creek, Georgia — jumped from the ship is unknown. But in a short statement, Carnival said his family believed he thought he was going swimming.

Visit Website  In Washington state alone, Coast Guard personnel spend 600 hours every month responding to unmanned boats that are adrift—and those Pacific Northwest personnel are far from alone. In November, the Coast Guard engaged a Jayhawk air crew, Coast Guard Cutter and Ocean Sentry air crew to resolve the mystery of a 30-foot sailboat adrift in the Gulf of Mexico. Also in November, the Coast Guard spent nearly six hours searching Narragansett Bay in Rhode Island after spotting an unmanned 14-foot skiff and fearing the owner had gone overboard into the frigid waters. (He was safe and warm at home.) In late January, the Coast Guard sent out a 140-foot icebreaker and a 65-foot icebreaking tug to handle a half dozen vessels that had broken loose on the Hudson River near Troy, New York.  USCG responds to a boat that is adrift.  The best-case scenario with a vessel adrift, Ettinger says, is that the Coast Guard can locate the owner and focus solely on the boat. “If there’s a registration on a vessel, and the owner answers a phone, then the case is over in maybe 15 minutes,” he says. “We say, ‘Hey, we found your boat, is everybody OK?’ They say, ‘We tied it up last night,’ and we say, ‘Well, it’s not tied up anymore. You have to come and get it.’”  Agency resources also become strained when boats break free and create a pollution problem. “If a vessel is adrift with oil on board and ends up on the rocks and breaks apart, now you have oil in the water as well,” Ettinger says.  Basic seamanship can go a long way toward keeping a boat where it belongs, whether tied to a mooring ball or a dock. For starters, all boaters should regularly inspect lines and replace any that are worn or weathered. Also double-check the vessel’s registration, to make sure it contains updated contact information. If strong winds are in the forecast, go to the boat and redouble any standard seamanship efforts. “Before gale warnings come in, go down to your boat and make sure all your lines are properly tied,” Ettinger says. “If you’re using a bow and stern line, double those lines up. Another common thing for smaller vessels, many people just take them out of the water, bring them up on shore and flip them upside down. But the minute the wind picks up, those aluminum and wood boats are going to end up in the water. Take the time to tie it down, or take it into a shed for the winter.”  These measures will help the Coast Guard return a boat, and enable the agency to determine if a person is truly missing. “This is all prudent seamanship, but I think people get complacent,” Ettinger says. “We need a little vigilance, especially before the bad weather comes.”

Moving the vessels around is a long-term maintenance plan based on putting the hulls in different environments, said Cmdr. Jason Haag, lead officer of the Fir since 2017 who is now at the helm of the Elm. “How can we make these vessels last 30 years?”  The Elm, commissioned in 1998, spent the first 20 years based in Atlantic Beach, North Carolina, maintaining buoys in a more hot, humid, oceanic environment on the East Coast before heading for a yearlong midlife overhaul in the Coast Guard Yard in Baltimore, Maryland. The Fir, commissioned in 2003, spent the first part of its life in the Pacific Northwest and heads for Cordova, Alaska, after its own midlife overhaul.

The Coast Guard cutter Elm, nicknamed ‘The Bar Tender’ for its role on the Columbia River, is responsible for maintaining about one-third of the Coast Guard’s large buoys, weighing about 9 tons apiece.  Buoy-tending tours often last a couple of weeks. But aside from a brief leave, the crew spent most of the past six months at the Coast Guard Yard preparing the ship for its new mission. They left early last month and steamed more than 6,000 miles down the East Coast, through the Panama Canal and up the West Coast to the Columbia.  The crew aboard the Elm remains largely the same as the Fir, aside from the yearly transfers in and out. Brian Schneider, a chief warrant officer on the Elm, estimates about one-third of the crew turns over each summer.  Mariners call in to the Coast Guard about broken buoys. Fixing them can mean anything from replacing the lights to pulling out buoys weighing up to 9 tons. Rough winter weather can snap buoys free from their anchors and send Coast Guardsmen searching.  “The ones in Puget Sound, they like to go to Canada for some reason,” Schneider said. “We kind of try to know where, roughly. You can figure out usually with the drifts where they’re heading. But usually the Canadian Coast Guard calls the U.S. Coast Guard and says, ‘Hey; we’ve got one of your buoys.’ We go up and retrieve it and put it back where it belongs.”  Along with navigational buoys, the Coast Guard helps government agencies like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration maintain weather and tsunami detection buoys. It tries to keep navigational buoys in service for at least 30 years, pulling them out on schedules like its ships for maintenance, Schneider said. Offshore buoys gather starfish, mussels and other sea life crawling up the anchor chain and covering the underside.

Edward Stratton/The Astorian  “We’ve pulled off almost 4,000 pounds of a buoy with the sea growth,” Schneider said.  Driving a buoy tender is the favorite job of Haag, who has been in the Coast Guard for 19 years, including on four separate buoy tenders. He plans to retire after his current tour.  “It’s dirty. It’s hard work. It’s exhausting. But when it’s done you go home,” Haag said.  Haag’s engineering officer, Chief Warrant Officer Clifford Mooneyham, recently hit 20 years worth of time spent at sea on 10 different Coast Guard cutters. Mooneyham keeps the Elm operational.  From South Carolina, Mooneyham originally planned on spending several years in the Coast Guard before leaving to become a game warden. But he soon fell for the service, fashioning a 30-year career below decks in the engine room. He later gained his captain’s license from Clatsop Community College’s maritime science program and became an officer of the deck.  Mooneyham will be honored next month as a master cutterman, a rare distinction for those who have reached 20 years at sea.  “I fell in love with the sea,” he said. “I fell in love with the ships.”

Crews were using a boat and helicopter to scour the ocean around the dock for the missing person, the Coast Guard said in a statement.  According to officials, the explosion happened on a fixed barge and fire then spread to the pier and the 99-foot commercial fishing vessel.  Initial reports were that two people were aboard the fishing vessel at the time. But Whittier, Alaska, police told the Coast Guard that one of the two was on a different boat and is safe.  The Coast Guard established a 100-yard (91-meter) safety zone to keep other boats away from the fire and search area.  The fishing boat, which had the capacity to carry about 5,500 gallons (20,820 liters) of fuel, sank in 85 feet (25 meters) of water, the Coast Guard said. A salvage crew has been hired by the vessel's owner.  Brian Hicks, the Whittier Fire Department's chief, told the Coast Guard that personnel from Whittier Fire Department, Whittier Police Department, Anton Anderson Memorial Tunnel Fire Department and Girdwood Fire Department all responded to the scene. The dock is operated by the city of Whittier.  The cause of the explosion is under investigation.  Kelly Bender and her family own a Whittier-based charter. Bender told the Anchorage Daily News that she heard the explosion.  Bender said her husband and son, who is an Anchorage firefighter, jumped into their boat to help.  ""They were able to get close enough and throw a grappling hook, about 40 feet,"" Bender said. ""They were able to just pull it off the dock to prevent more damage. I guess the boat sunk pretty quickly.""

In the video from June 18, members of the team are seen pounding on the hatch until one of the suspected smugglers emerges with his hands up. According to the Coast Guard, the vessel was seized by crew from the Coast Guard Cutter Munro.  The drugs seized during the dramatic boarding are among the estimated $569 million in drugs seized from the Pacific that were offloaded Thursday in San Diego, according to Coast Guard officials. In total, the Coast Guard seized 39 tons of cocaine and nearly 1,000 pounds of marijuana from drug smuggling vessels in the Eastern Pacific between May and July of this year.  Vice President Mike Pence attended the offloading of the drugs Thursday. In a speech, Pence praised the Coast Guard's work, saying, ""Make no mistake about it, Coasties, your courageous service is saving American lives."" Trending News

According to the release, ""The drugs represent 14 separate suspected drug smuggling vessel interdictions and disruptions off the coasts of Mexico, Central and South America by three Coast Guard cutters between May and July 2019.""  In a press briefing Thursday, Special Agent James Spero of U.S. Homeland Security Investigations announced that 55 suspected smugglers had been detained along with the drugs that were seized. He added that the seizures were a part of Operation Panama Express, a multiagency effort to stem the drug flow into the U.S. Most of the cocaine and marijuana offloaded Thursday will be used as evidence for investigations in Tampa.  Although the boats and submarines interdicted were in international waters, Spero noted that law enforcement is able to inspect the vessels because they ""are not flying a country's flag.""  The drug and vessel seizures are only the beginning of a long investigation, according to Spero. After the suspected smugglers onboard the vessels are detained and interviewed, the multiagency task force starts developing ""second-tier targets -- those responsible for the shipment and the building of the boats"" with the ultimate goal of ""dismantling the organization.""  When asked if the seizures were unusual, Spero said that ""homemade"" submarine seizures are ""not all that unusual,"" and added that the Coast Guard ""sees this amount of drugs every couple of months.""

(Brian Hicks/Girdwood Fire Department via AP)

An explosion at a dock in Alaska spread fire to a nearby fishing boat that then sank, leaving one person aboard missing, the U.S. Coast Guard said Monday.  Crews were using a boat and helicopter to scour the ocean around the dock for the missing person, the Coast Guard said in a statement.  According to officials, the explosion happened on a fixed barge and fire then spread to the pier and the 99-foot commercial fishing vessel.  Initial reports were that two people were aboard the fishing vessel at the time. But Whittier, Alaska, police told the Coast Guard that one of the two was on a different boat and is safe.  The Coast Guard established a 100-yard (91-meter) safety zone to keep other boats away from the fire and search area.  The fishing boat, which had the capacity to carry about 5,500 gallons (20,820 liters) of fuel, sank in 85 feet (25 meters) of water, the Coast Guard said. A salvage crew has been hired by the vessel's owner.  Brian Hicks, the Whittier Fire Department's chief, told the Coast Guard that personnel from Whittier Fire Department, Whittier Police Department, Anton Anderson Memorial Tunnel Fire Department and Girdwood Fire Department all responded to the scene. The dock is operated by the city of Whittier.  The cause of the explosion is under investigation.  Kelly Bender and her family own a Whittier-based charter. Bender told the Anchorage Daily News that she heard the explosion.  Bender said her husband and son, who is an Anchorage firefighter, jumped into their boat to help.  ""They were able to get close enough and throw a grappling hook, about 40 feet,"" Bender said. ""They were able to just pull it off the dock to prevent more damage. I guess the boat sunk pretty quickly.""

The Coast Guard spent Friday night combing the Galveston Bay for the Kemah Police chief after a wave from a large vessel threw him overboard, according to authorities.
Chris Reed, 50, wasn't wearing a life jacket when the pleasure craft he was on was rocked by the boat's wake around 4 p.m. He lost his balance and fell in, Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Caren Damon said at a news conference late Friday.
FORT BEND:  Authorities investigate possible child drowning near Katy
Reed and his wife launched the boat in the Clear Lake area, according to police radio traffic. She saw him fall overboard north of the levee.
""Large boat came by and knocked her husband off the boat,"" a dispatcher said. ""She hasn't seen him since.""
Texas City Police Department received the emergency call and about a dozen agencies responded to the bay, including the Coast Guard.
Damon vowed to keep crews on the water searching for Reed through the night and ""for as long as we believe he is viable on the surface.""
Reed, an Army veteran, has served as Kemah police chief since 2016 and is a trustee for Clear Creek ISD, where his wife is a teacher. He has three children.
Texas City Police Chief Joe Stanton called Reed ""a great cop.""
""He was a big part of Kemah and everything they were accomplishing and doing over there,"" Stanton said at a news conference near the levee. ""He's one of ours and we're out there and we're going to find him.""
The search prompted an outpouring of social media messages, including several tributes from members of Houston's wrestling community. Reed founded the Houston Area Wrestling Foundation for at-risk youth.
""I pray that somehow, the toughness he got from wrestling, military, and law enforcement, and fighting helps him survive long enough for authorities to find him today as he was knocked off a boat with a nasty undertow,"" wrote Mike Moor, wrestling director of W4R Training Center in Tomball.
Reed, a graduate of Sam Houston State University and LeTourneau University, previously worked as the city manager in Nassau Bay and at the League City Police Department as its assistant chief.

The Coast Guard initially received the report of the missing man from Virginia Beach dispatch at approximately 1 p.m., Tuesday.  Crews from Coast Guard Air Station Elizabeth City, North Carolina, and Coast Guard Station Little Creek searched a total of 347 square miles.  Personnel from the Virginia Beach Fire Department, Virginia Beach Police Helicopter, Virginia Beach Police Department, Virginia Marine Resource Commission, Virginia Marine Police, National Parks Service and the False Cape State Park also participated in the search efforts on shore, air and sea.  “We never make the decision to suspend lightly and in this particular case, it’s especially difficult,” said Capt. Kevin Carroll, commander of Coast Guard Sector Hampton Roads. “We share our deepest sympathies with the family of a man who risked his own life to save another.”

Release Date: 
June 7, 2019
June 5 through 6, Acting Secretary Kevin K. McAleenan traveled to Fort Lauderdale and Miami, Florida  to view a U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) drug offload, tour the National Hurricane Center (NHC) and meet with Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officials.
During his visit, McAleenan met with the crew of the USCG Cutter Hamilton, which had just returned to Port Everglades after confiscating drugs including over 26,000 pounds of cocaine worth an estimated $348 million wholesale, and over 1,400 pounds of marijuana worth an estimated $1.3 million seized in international waters in the Eastern Pacific Ocean. The drugs represent 15 separate suspected drug smuggling vessel interdictions and disruptions in the Eastern Pacific off the coasts of Mexico and Central and South America by three Coast Guard cutters between March and May 2019. The Acting Secretary, along with Coast Guard District Seven Commander Peter Brown, Commanding Officer U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Hamilton Mark Gordon, and senior officials from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Department of Justice (DOJ), also discussed the work the Coast Guard undertakes to disrupt transnational criminal organizations that profit off of human trafficking and illicit drug smuggling.
“I am proud of the work our U.S. Coast Guard doesto combat transnational criminal organizations who profit from human misery through human and drug trafficking, exacerbate crime levels in the region, and pump dangerous drugs into our country,” McAleenan said. “DHS has a strong interagency partnership to disrupt, dismantle, and prosecute these proliferators of crime.
Also on Thursday, the Acting Secretary toured the National Hurricane Center, which is the epicenter of predicting and tracking hurricanes throughout the Atlantic hurricane season. He received a briefing from Director Ken Graham and NHC leadership on the operational priorities, capabilities and goals of the NHC, as well as their outlook for the 2019 hurricane season. June 1 marked the beginning of Atlantic hurricane season, which is naturally a busy time for the NHC and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). However, DHS and FEMA work throughout the year with our state, local and tribal partners to instill a continual sense of preparedness that increases community resilience in the face of natural disasters.
“If past years are any indication, the 2019 hurricane season will test our response and recovery efforts,” McAleenan said. “At DHS and FEMA, we are not only responding to natural disasters as they occur, but building a lasting culture of resilience that will see us through the worst of hurricane seasons.”
Finally, the Acting Secretary met with TSA personnel at Miami International Airport to discuss challenges to aviation security. The Acting Secretary viewed a demonstration of a computed tomography machine, which allows screeners to have a more comprehensive, 3-D view of potentially threatening items. This technology is another example of TSA’s innovative methods to maintain aviation security.

MIAMI — The search continued Friday morning for a 37-year-old man who fell overboard from the cruise ship Carnival Victory.  Crew members aboard the Coast Guard Cutter Charles Sexton searched throughout  the night, according to Petty Officer 3rd Class Brandon Murray. A Coast Guard Air Station Miami HC-144 Ocean Sentry airplane rejoined the search at daylight Friday.  Coast Guard 7th District watchstanders received a report Thursday from the Carnival Victory that a crew member had fallen overboard about 30 miles northwest of Cuba.  Both the HC-144 and the cutter Charles Sexton searched the area Thursday.  According to Carnival's website, the Victory is based out of Miami.

Other incidents aboard cruise ships  In December, an  autistic man disappeared from a Carnival cruise ship after climbing a railing along the side of the vessel and went overboard, according to Carnival.  More:    Autistic man who went overboard on Carnival ship may have wanted to swim, family says  The incident took place on the 2,052-passenger Carnival Fantasy, which was on a five-night cruise out of Mobile, Alabama. The vessel was in the Gulf of Mexico at the time.  The reason the man — identified by his family as 22-year-old Luke Renner of Johns Creek, Georgia — jumped from the ship is unknown.

Author: WWL Staff Published: 7:00 AM EDT July 13, 2019 Updated: 9:17 PM EDT July 13, 2019  NEW ORLEANS — Four elderly people trapped in a coastal Louisiana community that was cut off from rising water from Hurricane Barry have been rescued by a U.S. Coast Guard helicopter.  Another eight people who were also trapped on Isle de Jean Charles in Terrebonne Parish had to be rescued by boat.  The Coast Guard shared video of one of those rescues - a 77-year-old man who had to be hoisted to safety after getting trapped in his home in four feet of water. 

Terrebonne Parish leaders called a voluntary evacuation order Friday for the low-lying areas, including Isle de Jean Charles.  Isle de Jean Charles is a narrow stretch of land near the southern coast of Terrebonne Parish about 45 minutes from Houma, Louisiana. The Coast Guard says the only road into the community, Island Road, is impassible due to rising waters.  The storm threatening the Louisiana coast had briefly strengthened to a Category 1 hurricane before quickly deteriorating back into a tropical storm.

The storm threatening the Louisiana coast has strengthened to a hurricane.  The U.S. National Hurricane Center said in its 11 a.m. Saturday advisory that Barry had reached maximum sustained winds of 75 mph, with higher gusts.  Hurricane-force winds were measured some 45 miles to the east of the storm's center, which was located 40 miles south of Lafayette, Louisiana. It was moving northwest at 6 mph.  Weather forecasters said a hurricane warning is in effect for Intracoastal City to Grand Isle. Such a warning means that hurricane conditions are expected within the warning area.

The port was reopened about 6 a.m. and vessels were once again allowed into and out of the Mississippi River and the port, according to a press release from the Coast Guard.  The Coast Guard formally closed the Mississippi to all traffic from the river's mouth as far up as Angola on Friday as Barry approached as a tropical storm. Over the previous days, the pilots who steer ships on the river had stopped bringing vessels into or out of the mouth of the river and the port had stopped loading operations in anticipation of the storm.

The description of the video completely undersells just how dramatic it is, saying simply that crew members “boarded” the vessel.  Yeah, “boarded.” They had to pull up to this sub in their boat, jump onto the submarine while both their boat and the sub were moving, in the middle of the ocean, and then stand there and hang on to the top of the sub, bang on the hatch until one of the smugglers opened it up, and make the bust. All in a days work, right?

Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to attend a Coast Guard drug offload Thursday in San Diego.  The crew of the Coast Guard Cutter Munro will offload more than 39,000 pounds of cocaine and 933 pounds of marijuana worth a combined estimated $569 million, which was seized in international waters in the Eastern Pacific Ocean.  The drugs represent 14 separate suspected drug smuggling vessel interdictions and disruptions off the coasts of Mexico, Central and South America by three Coast Guard cutters between May and July 2019.  It continues…  The Coast Guard increased U.S. and allied presence in the Eastern Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Basin, which are known drug transit zones off of Central and South America, as part of its Western Hemisphere Strategy. During at-sea interdictions, a suspect vessel is initially detected and monitored by allied, military or law enforcement personnel coordinated by Joint Interagency Task Force-South based in Key West, Florida. The law enforcement phase of counter-smuggling operations in the Eastern Pacific is conducted under the authority of the 11th Coast Guard District, headquartered in Alameda, California. The interdictions, including the actual boarding, are led and conducted by members of the U.S. Coast Guard.  Watch Vice President Pence deliver his remarks to the U.S. Coast Guard below…  Share This

Victoria describes herself on her website : “I’m a potty-mouthed interiors nut with a passion for spinning humorous yarns and continuously re-decorating my house.”  Speaking about her post-partum difficulties, Victoria said: “when you suddenly find yourself with a swollen vagina, nipples the size of digestive biscuits and enormous piles hanging out your anus it can come as a massive shock, and you can feel very alone and abnormal.”  Victoria describes her newborn daughter, Edith, in one post as the “anus impaler” who “conquered my cervix with her giant cranium.”  Her outspoken nature has garnered a lot of positive reaction online.

The Coast Guard has been preparing for Barry and has plenty of resources and staffing ready to go as the storm passes through the Gulf Coast states.     Thomas said the Coast Guard learned and implemented lessons from Hurricane Harvey, where they were not prepared nor planned for dealing with 60 inches of rain in Houston. The federal agency updated operational methods to better “track who's calling for help, where they're calling for help from, which units are closest, how we can dispatch them so we have a better common operational picture,” Thomas said.  share with Facebook  share with Twitter  share with email  share link  23 hr 1 min ago This is what the damage in Morgan City, Louisiana, looks like  Alexander Garcia took video of damage to his neighbor's house in Morgan City, Louisiana.

1  /  29 Back to Gallery  NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Tropical Depression Barry dumped rain as it slowly swept inland through Gulf Coast states Sunday, sparing New Orleans from a direct hit but stoking fears elsewhere of flooding, tornadoes, and prolonged power outages.  Though the system was downgraded to a tropical depression Sunday afternoon and its winds were steadily weakening since it made landfall Saturday in Louisiana, Barry's rain bands created a flooding and tornado threat stretching from central Louisiana to eastern Mississippi and beyond. Several Louisiana parishes were under flash-flood warnings Sunday night. U.S. Coast Guard holds Hurricane Barry briefing The U.S. Coast Guard says it has rescued a number of people stranded in their homes in Louisiana because of life-threatening storm conditions.

(July 13) Media: Associated Press  Far from the storm's center, tornado warnings were issued Sunday morning in both states, though no serious damage or injuries were reported.  On Sunday evening, Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said he was ""extremely grateful"" that Barry had not caused the disastrous floods that had earlier been forecast.  ""This was a storm that obviously could have played out very, very differently,"" he said. ""We're thankful that the worst-case scenario did not happen."" Coast guard rescues man, dog from Barry The U.S. Coast Guard released video of a helicopter crew rescuing a 77-year-old man and a dog from a home after floodwaters from Tropical Storm Barry inundated southern Louisiana. (July 14) Now Playing: Coast guard rescues man, dog from Barry AD:  The U.S. Coast Guard released video of a helicopter crew rescuing a 77-year-old man and a dog from a home after floodwaters from Tropical Storm Barry inundated southern Louisiana. (July 14) Media: Associated Press  President Donald Trump asked people across the region to keep their guard up, saying on Twitter Sunday: ""A big risk of major flooding in large parts of Louisiana and all across the Gulf Coast. Please be very careful!""  Forecasters warned of a continued threat of heavy rains into Monday as the center of the storm trudged inland. The U.S. National Hurricane Center said Sunday parts of south-central Louisiana could still have rainfall totals of up to 12 inches (30 centimeters), with isolated pockets of 15 inches (38 centimeters).  ""This rainfall is expected to lead to dangerous, life-threatening flooding,"" forecasters wrote in an advisory Sunday.  In Mississippi, forecasters said 8 inches (20 centimeters) of rain had fallen in parts of Jasper and Jones counties, with several more inches possible. With torrential rain pounding the state's Interstate 59 corridor, only the headlights of oncoming cars were visible on the highway, and water flowed like a creek in the median.  Barry's center continued to move through northern Louisiana into Arkansas. The system, which had briefly become a Category 1 hurricane, had its maximum winds fall to 35 mph (56 kph).  New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell said Sunday the city was ""beyond lucky"" that rainfall there fell well short of early predictions of a deluge that could overwhelm the city's pumping systems.  ""We were spared,"" she said at a news conference, while noting the city was ready to help nearby parishes hit harder.  In a sign that the city was returning to normal, flights were resuming Sunday at its airport. Restaurants reopened, and people were retrieving their cars from medians and other high ground.  About 60,000 customers in Louisiana, 3,300 customers in Mississippi and another 1,200 customers in Arkansas were without power Sunday evening, according to poweroutage.us.  Carrie Cuchens, who lost power at her home southeast of Lafayette, said crews were out working to remove trees that fell on power lines. Forecasters say the area, where several parishes were under a flash flood warning, could see 2 inches (5 centimeters) of additional rain on Sunday. Though some yards had pooling water, Cuchens didn't think her or her neighbors' homes would flood.  ""There's certainly water, certainly a lot of water, and as it continues to rain there's always that concern,"" she said.  Another worry is that large trees could topple because of the saturated ground.  ""If this rain sits on top of us, the ground of course now is already saturated,"" she said. ""The roots are so saturated that if any wind, or any kind of shift happens, they're easier to come up out of the ground. It's not snapping limbs - it's the whole entire tree. We have 100-year-old trees back here.""  To the southeast in Morgan City, Lois and Steve Bergeron spent Sunday cleaning up their lawn, which was littered with debris from trees. They were grateful the damage wasn't worse.  ""At least it didn't hit our house,"" she said.  And in Mandeville, north of New Orleans along Lake Pontchartrain, Michael Forbes was also picking up limbs and other debris at his home as a drizzle fell. Water got under his house, which is on stilts, but there was no damage and the power never went off.

Rough water and high waves hindered divers on Sunday and Monday in the search for Rahem Mason. And though a U.S. Coast Guard boat, a Michigan City Fire Department drone and watchers along the shore and in a helicopter have been used for three days, the teen had not been found as of late Tuesday evening.  La Porte County Coroner Bob Cutler said at one point Tuesday, his office was notified that searchers may have found a body in the lake, but it turned out to be nothing but a blanket.  He said the ""aggressive search"" was ongoing.  Witnesses saw Mason, who was swimming, disappear beneath the waves and not resurface at around 7:07 p.m. Saturday, according to Indiana Department of Natural Resources Law Enforcement Officer Tyler Brock.  Divers from the Michigan City Police Department, La Porte County Sheriffs Department, Michigan City Fire Department, and IDNR Conservation officers met Monday morning and determined conditions remained unsafe to conduct dive operations due to five-foot waves in the Washington Park area.  Waves crashed over the breakwall as members of the various departments walked the lighthouse pier to visually search the area near the pier, and the Fire Department launched a UAV (drone) to search the area from the air, Brock said.  Conservation officers had also planned a sonar search by boat Monday afternoon, but lake conditions made that impossible as well. But divers and the boat were back in the water Tuesday morning, he said.  Mason, the youngest of eight children in his family, was to be a junior at South Bend Washington High School this fall. He was at the beach with a group from his church, according to family members.  After he was reported missing, firefighters arrived and began to manually search the water, Brock said. But high waves and strong currents prevented a search by scuba divers.  A U.S. Coast Guard vessel also responded and searched the area, while the Coast Guard helicopter conducted an air search.  ""The incident occurred after normal swimming hours and the water had been closed to swimming throughout the day due to dangerous waves and currents,"" he said.  The National Weather Service had issued a Beach Hazard Advisory because of winds that were causing high waves and possible rip currents. That advisory remained in effect until Sunday evening, with waves of 3-5 feet, dangerous swimming conditions, and strong structural and rip currents.  Winds diminished late Monday and remained calm on Tuesday.  As of last week, there had been 13 drownings in Lake Michigan in 2019, according to the Great Lakes Surf Rescue Project, including two in Indiana.  On Feb. 11, Scott Tharp, 59, of Gary died of accidental drowning. A fisherman found Tharp’s body four days later in a public fishing area at the Port of Indiana near Burns Harbor, a Coast Guard crew near the port recovered the body.  And on May 18, 23-year-old Jacob Sandy of Michigan was seen kayaking off Porter Beach. His body was discovered 11 days later by an Indiana Dunes National Park employee about a quarter-mile east of Porter Beach on the shore of Lake Michigan.  Last year there were 43 drownings in Lake Michigan, including two in Michigan City, according to the GLSRP.  —From staff reports

DESTIN — A face full of glass was not on Robert Wagner’s itinerary when he got out of bed on Friday.  But that’s what happened when the three-year Okaloosa County Sheriff’s Office deputy responded to a report of a boat in distress in the Destin East Pass.  “One of our beach guys heard (Destin) Beach Safety talking a vessel in distress in the East Pass,” said Wagner, who is a member of the department’s Marine Unit.  He and Deputy Daryl Culberson dispatched from the Destin Coast Guard station just before 5 p.m. in the department’s Safe Boat, a 25-foot vessel purpose-built to handle rough water. The boat had been previously owned by the Coast Guard.  “It was a mess,” Wagner said of the East Pass. Large waves stirred up by Tropical Storm Barry, now Hurricane Barry, were heading northward through the channel, and an outgoing tide made the water even more treacherous.  As the two fought their way through the turbulent water toward a pontoon boat, which apparently had fouled its prop with the anchor line, Wagner saw the approaching wave.  “We got another big one coming here,” he said, warning Culberson to brace himself. ""Big one.""  The wave broke over the bow and hit the windshield, knocking it out. Wagner was slammed with broken glass, as was Culberson, as water poured into the boat.  “I found a good trough to turn around in and we headed back in,” Wagner said, explaining that with the window blown out they could not continue. They notified the Coast Guard and as they docked at Station Destin, a Coast Guard boat was headed out to assist the floundering pontoon boat.  “There were no deep cuts,” Wagner said after EMS personnel checked him out. “Little cuts. Nothing significant.”  Still, workplace rules required that he be checked out, and he went to Destin ER. His lacerations did not require stitches. He did receive a tetanus shot as a precaution. Culberson’s wounds were also minor.  Will he go out again?  “No hesitation,” he said immediately. “There’s nothing better we do than safeguarding a life.”  .embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }  Never miss a story

Am ex-con in Florida was wearing a shirt emblazoned with the word “COKE” while selling crack cocaine to an undercover agent last week, an arrest affidavit said.
Terry Leon Simmons, 53, was arrested Friday afternoon in his Fort Pierce home – about a 2-hour drive north of Miami – on a charge of felony cocaine sales. He was slapped with another felony charge after officers found marijuana “in plain view” and “what appeared to be” ecstasy next to his bed, the affidavit said .
Terry Leon Simmons was arrested in his Florida apartment last week on drug-related charges.  (St. Lucie County jail )
Police said Simmons sold crack cocaine to a driver outside a convenience store near his apartment on June 5. A probable cause affidavit said officers observed a suspect wearing a “blue shirt with red lettering on the front that said ‘COKE."" He allegedly sold four crack cocaine rocks for $40.

ASTORIA, Ore. — The Coast Guard Cutter Elm arrived in Astoria, its new homeport, for the first time, Monday.  The Elm, a Juniper Class 225-foot seagoing buoy tender, is operated by the same crew that operated the Coast Guard Cutter Fir, which left Astoria, June 2018 as part of a Coast Guard-wide hull swap.  The Elm is coming out of a midlife, dry-dock, major-overhaul period at the Coast Guard Yard in Baltimore. The major overhaul began in January 2018.  The Elm, commissioned in 1998, was previously homeported in Atlantic Beach, North Carolina, as part of Sector Field Office Macon, North Carolina. It spent the last 20 years maintaining over 250 floating aids to navigation from central New Jersey to the border of North and South Carolina.  The Elm’s primary mission will continue to be servicing aids to navigation, but its new area of responsibility stretches along the Pacific coasts of Oregon and Washington as well as in the Columbia River. Its area extends from the Oregon/California border north to the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and east in the Columbia River to Longview, Washington.  The aids that its crew will service and maintain are essential to commercial vessel traffic in shipping ports such as Coos Bay, Newport, Astoria, Portland, Longview, and Seattle.  The Elm’s crew will be responsible for 114 floating aids. The buoys, which the crew normally service, range in size from 13-feet tall and 5-feet wide to 35-feet tall and 9-feet wide and weigh up to 18,000 pounds. The Elm has heavy lift capabilities with a crane that can extend to 60 feet and lift up to 40,000 pounds.

Officials were not able to locate the crew member, who was identified as Gaffar Satwilkar by WSVN .  Satwilkar’s brother, Mohammed Satwilkar, told the station: “We all are waiting for him. We want him to come back as soon as possible.” He added that his brother is a father of three children.  The Coast Guard suspended its search Sunday for a missing Carnival Victory crew member who reportedly went overboard July 4 about 30 miles northwest of Cuba. https://t.co/a6BD5lQlLP

The Carnival Victory was traveling on July 4 from Cozumel, Mexico, to its home port in Miami, Florida, reported Fox News .  “The ship’s command immediately returned to the location where the crew member was last seen and initiated search and rescue activities, which are ongoing,” a Carnival spokesperson told Fox.  Other details about the incident are not clear. Lawsuit Filed in Another Case  A lawsuit was filed in a federal court in Miami,  Florida , claiming that Carnival Cruise Line officials refused to let a passenger off a cruise ship to seek medical attention after a  heart  attack.  Jeffrey Eisenman was on the Carnival Sunshine with his wife and children when he suffered “major heart attack” in December 2018, the  Miami Herald reported on June 12.  The Pennsylvania man “died onboard while confined to the medical center of the Carnival Sunshine against his will,” said a lawsuit filed by Ira Leesfield of Miami’s Leesfield Scolaro, representing the family of Eisenman. “His family was forced to watch on in horror at his mistreatment and decline into a gruesome death.”  Carnival objected to the family’s claims.

(Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images)  “We are very sorry for the Eisenman family’s loss, but the scenario that is alleged in the lawsuit is not accurate,” Carnival told the Herald. “Our onboard medical team followed all proper procedures to attend to a guest who became critically ill very quickly, including liaising with the local hospital which was not equipped to handle his condition. Mr. Eisenman’s treatment plan and keeping him on the ship was formulated in consultation with his family.”  The lawsuit also alleged that on the ship, while it was docked in the Turks and Caicos islands, Eisenman began vomiting and felt pain in his chest and left arm. A doctor then saw him, saying he had a “major heart attack,” the report said. Share this article

Sunday, June 30, 2019. Photo: Tyler Sizemore, Hearst Connecticut Media Storms, rough seas knock 18 people in the water of LI Sound 1  /  22 Back to Gallery  Strong thunderstorms created rough water conditions on Long Island Sound on Sunday.  The U.S. Coast Guard and its partner agencies responded to more than 20 cases of mariners in distress and 18 persons in the water wearing lifejackets after severe weather swept through western Connecticut and the Sound.  “In these cases, the Coast Guard rescued or assisted boaters across Long Island Sound ranging from taking on water, beset by weather, capsized, or disabled. In one case, a Coast Guard Station Eatons Neck boatcrew medically evacuated a female with an injured arm and safely transferred her to awaiting emergency medical services at Town Dock Pier in Huntington Bay,” the guard said Monday morning.  Stamford Marine Police Sgt. Kevin Fitzgibbons said he and his two boat crews were inundated by calls for help in and around Stamford Harbor when a squall came through Sunday afternoon.  Fitzgibbons said that earlier in the afternoon he was on patrol and warning boaters as they were leaving the harbor that some heavy weather was on its way and it would be best to turn back.  While some heeded his warnings, others continued on. While making safety checks, the police officers were able turn others back for a lack of life preservers and other missing equipment.  But just as the storm came tearing through the harbor, there were six calls for help with a number of people reportedly in the water, he said.  “The wall (of water) came through just as we thought and it was pandemonium for a little while. There were calls to 911, calls to our cell phones, VHF radio reports, police radio reports and email. There were six incidents going on at one time with reports of multiple people in the water,” he said Monday morning. Along with the two police boats, the fire department and harbor master also helped answer the distress calls.  Fitzgibbons said that when one kayaker fishing outside the harbor turned to see the blackened storm clouds racing toward him, he threw away his two fishing poles and started paddling to shore. He and his kayak were rescued by one of the police boats.  An 18-foot sailboat capsized, but the boat and crew were rescued by a Stamford Yacht Club chase boat.  One crew anchored and abandoned a boat outside Stamford Harbor, and the crew was taken aboard by another boat and brought into the harbor, Fitzgibbons said.  But no one was seriously injured and everyone turned out to be accounted for.  “Thank God if anything we only had minor injuries. Like I said, nothing too serious,” Fitzgibbons said.  After a busy weekend off Connecticut and Long Island, the guard is reminding the boating public to be prepared and to practice safe boating during the active summer season.  The Coast Guard recommends boaters check the forecasted weather conditions prior to departing shore.  In many cases, weather conditions can quickly deteriorate and catch boaters off guard and underprepared.  “The marine environment is complex and ever changing. That’s why prior to getting underway, always check the weather and ensure all required safety equipment is onboard,” said Cmdr. Valerie Boyd, search and rescue coordinator, Sector Long Island Sound.  “Many of the individuals are alive today because they were wearing lifejackets,” Boyd said.

Coast Guard Sector/Air Station Corpus Christi watchstanders received a report from the captain of a good Samaritan vessel who reported a vessel taking on water with two individuals aboard in Lower Laguna Madre.  Coast Guard Air Station Corpus Christi launched a HC-144 Ocean Sentry and an MH-65 Dolphin helicopter aircrew to the scene. The helicopter aircrew arrived on scene and hoisted the two boaters. The two mariners were transferred to awaiting emergency medical services personnel at the Charles R Johnson Airport in Port Mansfield.  The boaters were reported to be in stable condition.  The weather on scene was reported as 2-foot seas with 15 mph winds.

(Photo: AFP)  Semaisima: Qatar inaugurated its largest coast guard base Sunday as a standoff between Iran and the United States continues to boost tensions in strategic Gulf waters.  Prime Minister Abdullah bin Nasser bin Khalifa Al-Thani and commander of US Naval Forces in the Middle East Vice Admiral Jim Malloy attended the ceremony at the Al-Daayen naval base in Semaisima, 30 kilometres (18 miles) from Doha on Qatar's eastern coast.     Qatar, a key US ally in the region, is home to Washington's largest Middle East military base.  Malloy, commander of the US Fifth Fleet based in Bahrain, said the new base was ""a wonderful opportunity for us to interface more strongly with the Qatari coast guard.""  Tensions in the Gulf -- through which nearly a third of the world's oil is transported -- have spiked in recent weeks, with the US blaming Iran for multiple attacks on tanker ships in the region and Tehran shooting down an American drone.  The 600,000-plus square-metre site aims to ""facilitate the securing of all territorial waters of the State and border posts,"" the interior ministry wrote on Twitter.  It includes a ""sophisticated seaport,"" training and medical facilities, civil defence offices and operating rooms, the ministry added.  Asked whether the base could enhance US-Qatari coordination on Iran, Malloy said the move was ""all about maritime security, that's what our focus is.""  The US said Thursday it was discussing military escorts for vessels in the Gulf a day after armed Iranian boats allegedly threatened a British oil tanker in the Strait of Hormuz.

For some it's a weekly habit for Saturday night on the town, for others it's considered an occasional treat once or twice a month.
Across metropolitan Sydney the appetite for cocaine is insatiable. And what starts as a leaf in the hands of a Colombian subsistence farmer, quickly ends as a packet of fine white powder in the pocket of a Sydneysider.
Today, research from the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission suggests the nation's base of cocaine users is ""broadening,"" amid trends that point to a changing social acceptability of the drug.
But NSW Police Minister David Elliott said while it may be ""the drug of choice for the city's elite, that won't protect them from a cold jail cell"".
Advertisement
""The use of any illicit drug is unacceptable,"" he said, ""regardless of the demographic or reason and I'll be backing our police 100 per cent in their battle to rid this poison from our community.""
This week the Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research revealed a 7.7 per cent increase in the number of recorded criminal incidents for the use and, or, possession of cocaine over the past two years.
Loading
The increase is possibly a result of greater policing of the drug, and the targeting of areas where it is most prevalent, like Sydney's eastern suburbs.
In the local government area of Woollahra, where the average annual household income is more than $130,000, the number of incidents involving cocaine recorded by police has increased by an average 98.8 per cent each year, for the past two years alone.
Recent operations targeting the supply of cocaine in Sydney's east highlighted the brazen way in which buyers and sellers trade the drug on the streets, with 55 people on either side of cocaine transactions picked up by police.
""In NSW we have a major problem with the abuse of psychostimulants and the principle psychostimulants are cocaine and amphetamines. There is no doubt Sydney is the cocaine capital of Australia,"" the state's chief crime statistician Don Weatherburn said.
""My worry is that most of the current users are still only using on weekends or once a month, but if we get a large number using weekly or daily then we are going to see increases in other crime.""
From the city to the country, law enforcement has recorded a number of major cocaine seizures this year.
Like 68kg of the drug, which arrived in Sydney in April, concealed in furniture and worth $38 million. And this week, 30kg or $9 million worth, discovered in a large-scale drug lab on a property in Yass, in the Southern Tablelands.
In its most recent Illicit Drug Data Report the ACIC recorded 4623kg of cocaine had been seized nationally in 2016–17, equating to around 23 million hits, with an estimated street value of $1.7 billion.
""The world is inundated with cocaine at the moment, with record production in Colombia in particular,"" said Shane Neilson, ACIC's head of determination high risk and emerging drugs.

It doesn't take long before a kilo of coca leaves, worth around $200 to a poverty-stricken farmer in Colombia, becomes a kilo of cocaine sold in Australia for a wholesale price of between $180,000 and $300,000 – or on Sydney's streets for $300 a gram, a price that has not changed in more than a decade.
Mr Neilson said the only winners were organised crime groups.
""The significant increase in the profit margin for organised crime groups is when the cocaine crosses the border into Australia. Up until then, the profit for organised crime overseas is still tangible, but nothing like in Australia,"" he said.
Mr Neilson said the only price that was changing was the wholesale price for a kilo and above of cocaine; between crime groups selling to other crime groups.
But despite the $300 street price tag, he said ACIC research suggests ""the user base is broadening.""
It doesn't take long before a kilo of coca leaves, worth around $200 to a poverty-stricken farmer in Colombia, becomes a kilo of cocaine sold in Australia for a wholesale price of between $180,000 and $300,000.
""It’s fair to say cocaine has become less of an elitist drug than it was perceived to be two-to-five years ago. There was always this perception you would only get cocaine in certain socio-economic groups but more recent data bears out that it is no longer that way.""
Drug and Firearms Squad commander Detective Acting Superintendent Jayne Doherty said there were still stigmas and trends linked to certain drugs that impacted the way users engaged with illicit substances.
""If you're talking about drugs people consider to be party drugs, a lot of people in that scene don't really see an issue in it. So they are less clandestine ... in their use,"" she said.
""They have it on their person.
""But with other drugs there is a stigma ... like heroin, no one wants to be called a junkie ... it's about the opinion of the society they move in.
""Like with any commodity, one commodity is more socially accepted in one area than another.""
Detective Acting Superintendent Doherty said that targeting drugs involved more than making major seizures.
""It takes a multifaceted approach. The way we target drug crime is also through education ... and by reaching out to the community. We have had some brilliant seizure from little bits of information people give to us.""
Describing cocaine as a ""curse to society"" Mr Elliott said police would be given ""continued support to ensure they fight the international war on drugs.""

hello
EAST CAPE GIRARDEAU, Ill. -- The U.S. Coast Guard says it rescued 17 people and three dogs from floodwaters in Alexander County in southern Illinois.
Coast Guard officials said Wednesday small, lightweight, flat bottom boats that are suitable for navigating floodwaters in urban areas were deployed to help residents affected by the high waters of the Mississippi River.
According to the National Weather Service, the Mississippi crested at Cape Girardeau, Missouri at 46.4 feet, and will fall slowly.
Captain Scott Stoermer says the Coast Guard's Western Rivers Flood Punt Team spent over seven hours Tuesday conducting operations, which included evacuating people from a flooded trailer park.
The evacuation of mobile homes at East Cape Girardeau, Illinois was forced by a decision to cut off power because of the swollen river, which made electrical lines a hazard.
Stoermer said the Coast Guard is standing by to assist Alexander County if future assistance is requested.

Bauman’s brother, Rabbi Mordechai Bauman, lives in University Heights and flew to Virginia, accompanied by Rabbi Dovid Asher Schnurman, a principal of Yeshiva Derech Hatorah in Cleveland Heights. Mordechai Bauman is a teacher at the school.  At the Beachwood Kollel in University Heights, congregants read psalms after daily prayers on July 9 for Reuven Bauman.  The U.S. Coast Guard suspended the recovery operation about at 11:25 a.m. on July 10, 23 hours after Reuven Bauman was reported missing. However, family and Jewish volunteer rescue teams were combing the shore and continuing the search. Rabbi Aharon Lipman, who grew up in Cleveland Heights and University Heights and went to the Hebrew Academy of Cleveland in Cleveland Heights and graduated from Telse Yeshiva in Wickliffe, is a co-head camp counselor. He taught with Reuven Bauman at Toras Chaim, an Orthodox day school in Norfolk.  Virginia Beach EMS was dispatched to Back Bay National Wildlife Refuge between noon and 1 p.m. July 9, an area where swimming and surfing are expressly prohibited.  “Our condolences certainly go out to the family and friends,” said Bruce Nedelka, division chief and public information officer for the city of Virginia Beach Department of Emergency Services. “It’s a sad, sad, tragic situation.”  Red flags were posted at nearby public beaches on the Atlantic Coast, where waters were turbulent. There were riptides and currents flowing both north and south in different areas, Nedelka said.  Nedelka said the camper was taken to a local hospital for observation in stable condition, and that a frantic rescue search took place for Bauman. That rescue operation took place for about an hour and a half and then switched to a recovery operation, with the U.S. Coast Guard leading it.  City-hired emergency medical services-trained lifeguards were the first responders to the scene, arriving from Sandbridge about 2 miles away on jet skis, on an all-terrain vehicle and a four-wheel drive pickup truck. Virginia Beach fire and police also sent rescue boats to the scene.  An MH 60 Jay Hawk helicopter was sent to the scene from Elizabeth City, N.C., along with a Coast Guard cutter. In addition, a 45-foot Coast Guard Response Boat from Little Creek, Va., was sent to the area.  Nedelka estimated there were about two dozen personnel at the height of the operation.  Rabbi Pinchas Landis of University Heights, whose son, Moshe, 14, attends Yeshiva Aish Kodesh in Norfolk, said his son was shaken by the incident and knew Reuven Bauman through B’nai Israel Congregation.  Reuven Bauman taught at Toras Chaim, a day school in Norfolk, and attended B’nai Israel, where Moshe Landis met him.  Pinchas Landis said the Norfolk Orthodox community is tightknit and vibrant, with many young adults moving to the area.  He said he has been praying with Orthodox Jews around the world through a whatsapp Tehillim application.  “I know in the synagogues they’re saying extra tehillim (psalms),” Landis said. “And I know I’ve gotten numerous emails from my relations around the world that are encouraging extra Tehillim.” How do you feel about this article?

An alert for a reported swimmer in trouble near Redfish Pass off Captiva Island Sunday instead found a sea turtle doing what sea turtles do, resurfacing and diving.  Units from the U.S. Coast Guard's Fort Myers Beach Station, Captiva and Upper Captiva fire rescue, Lee County Sheriff's Office and others were involved Sunday afternoon in a water rescue at the northern tip of Captiva Island.  United States Coast Guard units from Fort Myers Beach and Clearwater have recovered the body of a man who failed to surface after a dive 18 miles off Sanibel Island Wednesday morning.   (Photo: Special to The News-Press)  The Florida Fish & Wildlife Commission said there was a report of a swimmer in trouble a few hundred feet off shore. A search alert was activated shortly after 1:30 p.m.  However, Upper Captiva Assistant Fire Chief Craig Denison later reported the swimmer turned out to be more animal than human.  ""Turned out to be a turtle,"" he said. ""Sea turtle kept resurfacing.""  Since June 28 one person drowned and another was rescued and resuscitated after being caught in rip currents off Captiva and North Captiva islands.  The National Weather Service issued a rip current advisory Saturday that extended through Sunday night.  The alert said increased swells would lead to a high risk for rip currents.

The dining area has large windows, and one pane was open.

Mr Anello sat the 18-month-old girl in the window and lost his balance, and she fell to her death. ""Sadly, she died on impact,"" Carmona said.

Local police are still investigating the incident, which preliminarily has been determined to be an accident, Carmona said. The girl's body was taken to a forensic unit in San Juan. Falls from cruise ships are not unheard-of. On Thursday, a Carnival Victory crew member was seen falling overboard about 48 kilometres northwest of Cuba. The US Coast Guard searched for the 37-year-old man but failed to find him after more than 45 hours and so suspended the effort. The Coast Guard does not estimate the total number of falls from ship decks each year, spokesman Jonathan Lally said. Still, ""every cruise ship has a safety plan,"" and ""they are required to give a safety brief,"" he said. The Coast Guard ""strongly advises"" passengers who board ships to follow all safety rules and plans.   © Nine Digital Pty Ltd 2019

THAYER | STARS AND STRIPES Published: July 11, 2019  With Tropical Storm Barry churning across the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico, the military in Louisiana is preparing for its potential landfall this weekend as a hurricane.  The storm developed into a tropical storm on Thursday and is expected to become a category 1 hurricane by Saturday morning before making landfall along the central coastline of Louisiana, according to the National Weather Service.  The Louisiana National Guard, as directed by Gov. John Bel Edwards, has been authorized to activate up to 3,000 soldiers and airmen, according to a release from the state’s guard.  “The Louisiana National Guard is taking a proactive and aggressive approach in dealing with the preparations ahead of Tropical Storm Barry,” said Maj. Gen. Glenn H. Curtis, adjutant general of the Louisiana National Guard. “This will allow our guardsmen to be more successful in their priority missions immediately following the storm – search and rescue operations and commodities distribution.”  In addition to high-water vehicles and boats staged in more than 20 communities, the National Guard has helicopters ready to support search and rescue, evacuation and reconnaissance missions as needed.  Additional assets are being moved and staged in the New Orleans area and large quantities of drinking water, blankets and sandbags have been moved, delivered or positioned for distribution following the storm.  Meanwhile, Naval Air Station Joint Base New Orleans has brought all of its aircraft inside and tied down one C-130 airplane, said Navy MC1 Micah Blechner, spokesman for the base. The base will operate Friday with mission-essential personnel only.  Home to Marine Forces Reserve units, Air National Guard, Navy and Coast Guard, Joint Base New Orleans has about 5,000 people who work on the base daily, Blechner estimated. The aircraft taken indoors include FA-18 Hornet fighter jets and MH-60 Seahawk helicopters.  Coast Guard personnel at the base are on standby for search and rescue mission, he said.

Witnesses saw Rahem Mason ""go under the surface and did not see him above surface again,"" Conservation Officer Tyler Brock of DNR Law Enforcement said.  Within minutes, Michigan City firefighters arrived on scene and began to manually search the water, he said.  But high waves and strong currents prevented a search by scuba divers.  A U.S. Coast Guard vessel also responded and searched the area by boat, while a Coast Guard helicopter conducted an air search, Brock said.  ""Initial search efforts were unsuccessful and resumed Sunday morning,"" he said.  ""The incident occurred after normal swimming hours and the water had been closed throughout the day due to dangerous waves and currents,"" he said.  The National Weather Service had issued a Beach Hazard Advisory because of winds that were causing high waves and possible rip currents.  That advisory remained in effect until Sunday evening, with wave of 3-5 feet, dangerous swimming conditions, and strong structural and rip currents expected.  There have been 13 drownings in Lake Michigan so far in 2019, according to the Great Lakes Surf Rescue Project, including two in Indiana.  On Feb. 11, Scott Tharp, 59, of Gary died of accidental drowning. A fisherman found Tharp’s body four days later in a public fishing area at the Port of Indiana near Burns Harbor, a Coast Guard crew near the port recovered the body.  And on May 18, 23-year-old Jacob Sandy of Michigan was seen kayaking off Porter Beach. His body was discovered 11 days later by an Indiana Dunes National Park employee about a quarter-mile east of Porter Beach on the shore of Lake Michigan.

Gove criticised cocaine users pushing for legalisation in 1999 column
Environment Secretary Michael Gove has come under scrutiny over past drug use

Tory leadership hopeful Michael Gove criticised “middle-class professionals” who took drugs and wanted them to be legalised in a 1999 column for The Times newspaper, it has emerged.
The former journalist has come under fire this weekend after admitting that he took cocaine “on several occasions” 20 years ago.
He has said he “deeply regrets” using the drug and acknowledged it was “a mistake”.
In a column for The Times just before the turn of the millennium, the now-Environment Secretary criticised Channel 4 for plans to mark the occasion with a night of programmes about cocaine and said there were three reasons preventing him from “joining London’s liberal consensus”.
“The first is my belief that the energy with which so many journalists campaign for legalisation is driven not by logic but emotion. Guilt in particular,” he wrote.
“There is no greater sin in journalistic eyes than hypocrisy. It justifies a score of tabloid stings, a hundred broken careers. How dare the minister endorse family values while himself straying? And how can I live with my occasional spliff unless I use my column to campaign for legalising drugs?”
Sorry, this content isn't available on your device.
But a “greater sin than hypocrisy” was “the refusal to uphold values because one may oneself have fallen short of them”, he said.
The consequences of drug use to “middle-aged professionals” may be easier to cope with than to those from less fortunate backgrounds, he warned.
Mr Gove also highlighted the effect of drugs liberalisation in The Netherlands, claiming the country had twice as many heroin addicts per capita as Britain, and said his third reason against relaxing policy was that there was no “countervailing force against the power of drugs” other than the law itself.
According to the Mail on Sunday, Mr Gove hosted a party the night before the column was published in which the Class A drug was allegedly taken by guests.
Home Secretary Sajid Javid, a leadership rival to Mr Gove, told Sky News “It’s not for me to pass judgment on fellow candidates” but added: “People do need to know – it doesn’t matter if you are middle class or not – anyone who takes class A drugs, they need to think about that supply chain that comes from Colombia, let’s say, to Chelsea and the number of lives that are destroyed along the way.”
Following the revelations about his past drug use, some MPs pushed for Mr Gove to campaign for reform and the potential decriminalisation of some drugs.
Tory former prisons minister Crispin Blunt said Mr Gove’s drug use “whilst illegal, was wholly unexceptional” and said he should have acknowledged the need for reform of the law.
“The time has come for all serious politicians to engage with the debate around these issues,” said Mr Blunt, chairman of the all-party parliamentary group for drug policy reform.
“Sadly Michael – like others before him – has delivered a politically crafted and deeply unconvincing handwringing statement of regret for committing a victimless crime. The victims have largely been created by policy and the law.
“As a leadership candidate he should have used the opportunity of his own confession to join a vital and urgent policy debate.”
Sorry, this content isn't available on your device.
Green MP Caroline Lucas said it was “rank hypocrisy” to admit to “mistakes” while “backing policies that perpetuate harm”.
But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he was “unconcerned about Michael Gove’s past life or behaviour”, while leadership rival Dominic Raab said his admission should not prevent him from running to be the next prime minister.
Mr Gove told the Daily Mail: “I took drugs on several occasions at social events more than 20 years ago.
“At the time I was a young journalist. It was a mistake. I look back and think ‘I wish I hadn’t done that’.
“It was 20 years ago and yes, it was a mistake. But I don’t believe that past mistakes disqualify you.”

The 18-month-old girl was playing with her grandfather in a dining hall on deck 11 of the Freedom of the Seas , Port Authority spokesman José Carmona said. The dining area has large windows, and one pane was open.  The grandfather sat the girl in the window and lost his balance, and the girl fell to her death. “Sadly, she died on impact,” Carmona said.  The toddler’s father is a police officer in South Bend, Indiana, according to the South Bend Police Department. The department tweeted “its sincerest condolences” to the officer and his family “during this difficult time following the tragic loss of their child while in Puerto Rico.” The department also asked the community to pray for and to respect the privacy of the entire family.  The girl had traveled to San Juan from the mainland with her parents, siblings and four grandparents. They had recently boarded the ship, which can carry more than 4,500 passengers, including crew.  The ship was scheduled to depart for a weeklong voyage at 8:30 p.m. Sunday; the fall happened about 5 p.m., according to Carmona.  “We are deeply saddened by yesterday’s tragic incident, and our hearts go out to the family,” Royal Caribbean Cruises said. “We’ve made our Care Team available to assist the family with any resources they need. Out of respect for their privacy, we do not plan to comment further on the incident.”  Local police are still investigating the incident, which preliminarily has been determined to be an accident, Carmona said. The girl’s body was taken to a forensic unit in San Juan.  Falls from cruise ships are not unheard-of. On Thursday, a Carnival Victory crew member was seen falling overboard about 30 miles northwest of Cuba.  The US Coast Guard searched for the 37-year-old man but failed to find him after more than 45 hours and so suspended the effort.  The Coast Guard does not estimate the total number of falls from ship decks each year, spokesman Jonathan Lally said. Still, “every cruise ship has a safety plan,” and “they are required to give a safety brief,” he said. The Coast Guard “strongly advises” passengers who board ships to follow all safety rules and plans.

Prime Minister Abdullah bin Nasser bin Khalifa Al-Thani and commander of US Naval Forces in the Middle East Vice Admiral Jim Malloy attended the ceremony at the Al-Daayen naval base in Semaisima, 30 kilometres from Doha on Qatar’s eastern coast.  Qatar, a key US ally in the region, is home to Washington’s largest Middle East military base.  Malloy, commander of the US Fifth Fleet based in Bahrain, said the new base was “a wonderful opportunity for us to interface more strongly with the Qatari coast guard”.  Tensions in the Gulf — through which nearly a third of the world’s oil is transported — have spiked in recent weeks, with the US blaming Iran for multiple attacks on tanker ships in the region and Tehran shooting down an American drone.  The 600,000-plus square-metre site aims to “facilitate the securing of all territorial waters of the State and border posts”, the interior ministry wrote on Twitter.  It includes a “sophisticated seaport”, training and medical facilities, civil defence offices and operating rooms, the ministry added.  Asked whether the base could enhance US-Qatari coordination on Iran, Malloy said the move was “all about maritime security, that’s what our focus is”.  The US said Thursday it was discussing military escorts for vessels in the Gulf a day after armed Iranian boats allegedly threatened a British oil tanker in the Strait of Hormuz.  And on Friday Britain said it was sending a second warship to the Gulf and raising the alert level in the oil-rich region after Iranian gunboats threatened a UK supertanker.

Port conditions are normal as of 6 a.m. CT on July 14, enabling vessel movement into and out of the Mississippi River and the Port of New Orleans, albeit with some restrictions, the U.S. Coast Guard said. Those restrictions can be found here .   The Coast Guard said early preparation and communication between federal, state, local and industry partners helped minimize the potential for damage at the port.  ""Even while the storm was still approaching landfall, we were making preparations to reopen our ports and restore critical infrastructure and marine transportation systems as quickly as possible after it passed,"" said Capt. Kristi Luttrell, Sector New Orleans commander for the Coast Guard. ""Along with the safety of the public and first responders, restoration of maritime commerce was one of our top priorities.""  The Port of New Orleans said all flood gates along the Mississippi River should be open by the afternoon of July 14, with the port's administration building expected to reopen on July 15 with regular schedules.  While the port is operating as normal, some roads that were closed on July 12 are still closed as of July 14, according to the Louisiana Department of Transportation . Up-to-date information on those roads is available here and an interactive map is available here .  The area's rail network also has some embargoes in place, but that could also change later this week. Union Pacific (NYSE: UNP ) placed embargoes on July 10 on two routes in Avondale and New Orleans, Louisiana, because of flooding, while Norfolk Southern (NYSE: NSC ) said on July 11 that it was working with interline partners to detour New Orleans-bound shipments to alternate gateways. Kansas City Souther n (NYSE: KSU ) said on July 12 that it placed embargoes traffic interchanging at New Orleans, while BNSF  said customers should expect delays and extended travel times for traffic in and out of New Orleans.  Meanwhile, the National Hurricane Center said life-threatening flooding rain will persist into July 15 as Barry heads into northwestern Louisiana, bringing potential flash floods. Widespread rainfall of 4 or more inches is expected, with areas of significantly higher rain leading to rapid water rises, the Center said on July 14. Weather.com tweeted that over 150,000 residents and businesses were without power on the morning of July 14.  Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said on July 14 that he activated 3,000 members of the Louisiana National Guard in response to the storm. The state's Emergency Operations Center is also fully activated, he said.  ""This storm has our attention,"" Edwards said. ""While most of the rain right now is in the Gulf, we know that it will be coming ashore and impacting a large portion of the state. We are asking that everyone stay vigilant and be safe. Monitor your local media and heed instructions from your local elected officials. The people of Louisiana are resilient, and while the next few days may be challenging, I am confident that we are going to get through this.""Tropical Storm Barry was downgraded from hurricane status after making landfall on July 13.

At a Glance A levee was overtopped in several places in Plaquemines Parish. Levees were also overtopped in two other parishes south of New Orleans. More than 128,000 Louisiana homes and businesses were without power Saturday afternoon. Residents in Mississippi were bracing for flooding as storm moves north. The U.S. Coast Guard rescued at least 11 people early Saturday in Terrebonne Parish.  As Tropical Storm Barry moved slowly inland Saturday evening, communities still in the storm's path continued to brace for heavy rainfall.  The storm, which came ashore as a hurricane but was quickly downgraded, caused at least three levees to overtop in parishes south of New Orleans Saturday afternoon, prompting evacuation orders. There were numerous reports of downed trees and power lines throughout southern Louisiana, as well as some localized flooding. The storm spawned several tornado warnings around Mobile, Alabama, and heavy rainfall along the Mississippi coast.  There were no immediate reports of deaths or major injuries.  The parish president of Lafourche Parish issued a recommended evacuation order for residents in Point Aux Chenes due to water overtopping a levee in that area at around 5:45 p.m. Saturday.  Meanwhile, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers official Mark Wingate told reporters on a conference call Saturday evening that authorities “ see no concerns at all about (water) overtopping the Mississippi River levees” that protect the city of New Orleans.  Earlier in the day, a 4-mile section of the Lower Dularge East Levee was overtopping in Terrebonne Parish, which prompted a mandatory evacuation for about 400 people living along Louisiana Highway 315 and Brady Road below or south of Falgout Canal, according to Angela Hidalgo, administrative manager of the Terrebonne Levee District.  Hidalgo told weather.com the section overtopping was the lowest part of the levee, at about 7 feet. Other parts of the levee have been lifted to 12 feet.  ""We did do a lot of work on the northern part of it and it fared very well,"" Hidalgo said. ""We were just kind of hoping we could get something in the lower part done before we had a tropical event, but we didn't quite make it.""  Another levee was overtopping in several places in Plaquemines Parish and is one of two in the parish not reinforced in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, although funding was allocated for the levee.  Louisiana Lt. Gov. Billy Nungesser told CNN “the water is coming over the levee pretty good,"" noting that the levee can withstand several hours of overtopping before a breach occurs. Should that happen, waters could flood a good portion of Plaquemines Parish, including the small town of Ironton.  The back levee that is not part of the Mississippi River levee system protects the Myrtle Grove and Pointe Celeste areas near Highway 23, one of the main roads through the parish.  The situation had eased by Saturday night and some residents who were under a mandatory evacuation order were allowed to return home, an employee with the parish's emergency management office told weather.com. &lt;img class=""styles__noscript__2rw2y"" src=""https://s.w-x.co/util/image/w/levee_1.jpg?v=at&w=485&h=273"" srcset=""https://s.w-x.co/util/image/w/levee_1.jpg?v=at&w=485&h=273 400w, https://s.w-x.co/util/image/w/levee_1.jpg?v=ap&w=980&h=551 800w"" &gt; Water overtops a levee in Plaquemines Parish. (Plaquemines Parish Sheriff's Department)

Extensive flooding was reported from Lake Pontchartrain in Mandeville, Louisiana, early Saturday.  ""The waves from the lake are crashing onto the land as if it is all one big lake,"" resident Ludovico Torri told CNN. ""The water is rising, too. In the last hour and a half, the water is up a foot. We’re stuck in the house with four kids and the car is almost flooding.""  The U.S. Coast Guard rescued several stranded people early Saturday.  Mart Black, Terrebonne Parish Homeland Security spokesperson, told the Associated Press at least 11 people and a cat were successfully rescued from Isle de Jean Charles in Terrebonne Parish and taken unharmed to a shelter in Houma, Louisiana.  The Coast Guard mounted an air rescue because strong winds prevented any attempt by sea.  “They could not land on the island because of the high water and it’s heavily wooded,"" Black told The Weather Channel.  The Coast Guard noted that they had received other calls from people stranded on the island that has been without power since Friday.  The narrow stretch of land is located about 45 miles from Houma. The only road into the community is reportedly impassable because of high water. The island was under a voluntary evacuation advisory.  The storm forced the cancellation of all flights into and out of Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport, as well as the majority of flights at Baton Rouge Metropolitan Airport . Some flights resumed Saturday night into New Orleans, and the airport announced that most flights should operate as planned Sunday.  More than 128,000 homes and businesses were without power Saturday afternoon, including half of Assumption Parish, west of New Orleans, according to PowerOutage.us. Most of those remained without power into Saturday night.  High water closed numerous roadways, including Highway 51 between the I-55 interchanges in Laplace and Ruddock near New Orleans and Louisiana 1 in Lafourche Parish.  A mobile home was crushed in Patterson, Louisiana, Saturday after a large tree fell. No injuries were reported.  St. Charles Parish officials has asked residents to limit sewer usage as much as possible.  “If you don’t need to wash clothes, don’t. If you don’t need to flush toilets , don’t flush toilets,” parish spokeswoman Adrienne Bourgeois told the Advocate Saturday morning.  The storm that was later downgraded to a tropical storm made landfall early afternoon Saturday near Intracoastal City.  More rainfall was forecast for parts of Louisiana and Mississippi overnight and Sunday.  As Barry continued to move north, residents in other parts of Louisiana as well as Mississippi prepared for more rainfall.  The U.S. Coast Guard was on standby for rescues in Slidell, Louisiana, according to WWL. Further north and west in the state, U.S. Army officials at Ft. Polk canceled activities and closed on-base shopping areas.  In Mississippi, people were especially wary in the Yazoo Delta area, where homes and thousands of acres of land have already been flooded for months.  Governor Phil Bryant told The Weather Channel more than 3,000 National Guardsmen were standing by, as well as water rescue teams. Shelters were also being opened in some areas. &lt;img class=""styles__noscript__2rw2y"" src=""https://s.w-x.co/util/image/w/602A7305-Edit.jpg?v=at&w=485&h=273"" srcset=""https://s.w-x.co/util/image/w/602A7305-Edit.jpg?v=at&w=485&h=273 400w, https://s.w-x.co/util/image/w/602A7305-Edit.jpg?v=ap&w=980&h=551 800w"" &gt; 1 of 190 Floodwaters from Lake Pontchartrain push into Donz On The Lake, in Mandeville on the lake’s northshore on July 13, 2019, when Tropical Storm Barry reached Hurricane status.

The fishing ban runs from May 20 to July 23 and Navy and Coast Guard vessels are patrolling the zone to prevent breaches.
Several thousand fishermen blocked Bangladesh’s busiest highway on Sunday, police said, as protests escalated over a two-month fishing ban in the Bay of Bengal.
The fishermen say the 65-day blockade — intended to replenish fish stocks — is driving them out of business. Their one-hour protest at the coastal town of Sitakunda caused tailbacks on the main road linking Dhaka and Chittagong.
Local police chief Suman Banik said the demonstration by 3,000 fishermen and their families was peaceful. They only cleared the road after a government administrator and a local Member of Parliament promised to help.
The fishing ban runs from May 20 to July 23 and Navy and Coast Guard vessels are patrolling the zone to prevent breaches. Bangladesh frequently bans deep sea fishing and catches in coastal rivers to help stocks, but this is the longest imposed for seas near the coast and fishing communities are furious.
About 15 million people in the region directly or indirectly depend on Bangladesh's multi-billion dollar fishing industry.
Shyamol Palit, an organiser of the demonstration, said the ban has hit poor fishermen hard, especially the Hindu Joldas community. More than 55,000 Joldas families live in the Chittagong region and are employed in coastal fishing mainly running their own small boats.
“The Joldas have taken loans to sail boats this season. This sudden and long embargo has put them in a debt trap,” he said.
The government has announced it will provide free rice for nearly half a million families of badly-affected fishermen. But Palit said the scheme is not wide enough and “you cannot run a family only with a sack of rice.”
The ban has also hit the nearly one million Rohingya refugees who live in camps in Bangladesh after fleeing violence in Myanmar's Rakhine state in recent years. The refugees are not officially allowed to work outside the camps, but thousands are secretly employed on trawlers owned by Bangladeshis.

The center of the storm as of 11 a.m. ET was about 40 miles south of Lafayette, Louisiana, and about 50 miles west of Morgan City, Louisiana, with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph and creeping at 6 mph.  Hurricane Barry is expected to make landfall at some point Saturday.  Tropical Storm Barry unloaded powerful winds and heavy rains as it edged closer to landfall Saturday along the Louisiana coast.  Landfall is expected within the next few hours along the Louisiana Coast https://t.co/tZoNuYL1uS

Barry is set to hit land Saturday morning or early afternoon as a Category 1 hurricane, the National Hurricane Center said. Its slow trek means a longer period of heavy rainfall and related flooding that will last through next week, forecasters said.  Rain bands are moving onshore in Louisiana as Barry inches northwest at 5 mph, also bringing 70 mph sustained winds, a dangerous coastal storm surge and a risk of tornadoes from southeast Louisiana to south Alabama.  Across the region, cities and parishes have issued mandatory evacuation orders, especially in low-lying areas and those outside public levee protection, along with voluntary evacuation warnings for other places, the governor said. For the first time since their construction, all major floodgates on the Mississippi River are closed, he added. A storefront on the edge of the French Quarter is boarded up to prevent damage in anticipation of Barry, on July 13,2019. (Scott Olson/Getty Images)  The state’s forces also have mobilized in anticipation of search and rescue missions, he said.  A rescue already was underway midmorning Saturday — and more calls for help had come in — in coastal Terrebonne Parish, east of Morgan City, the US Coast Guard said. At least a dozen people needed to be saved along Island Road, effectively a bridge that traverses the marshy bayou that opens into the gulf.  Four people and a cat were picked up by a MH-65 Dolphin helicopter and taken inland to Houma, Louisiana, Coast Guard Petty Officer Lexie Preston said. A 24-foot Coast Guard response boat also was launched from Morgan City to help with rescues.  Following President Trump’s state of emergency declaration, Louisiana officials activated 3,000 National Guard members in anticipation of Barry, the governor said. And despite the state’s long-honed expertise in facing this sort of threat and its enhanced post-Katrina storm defenses, residents were urged to be prepared. Over 62,000 Without Power  Though heavy, sustained rain still threatens the New Orleans area, fears there have relaxed as a predicted storm surge on the unusually high Mississippi River happened late Friday at a lower level than forecast, according to the National Weather Service in New Orleans. The developing factors had set off fears among some residents of the death and destruction wrought in 2005 by Hurricane Katrina, though weather and flood-infrastructure circumstances are not the same now.  A hurricane warning is in effect along part of the Louisiana coast, while inland areas, including the lower Mississippi Valley, are under tropical storm warnings. Storm surge warnings along the coast extend from Intracoastal City, south of Lafayette, to Biloxi, Mississippi, and along Lake Pontchartrain.  Tropical storm Barry is set to make landfall as a Category 1 hurricane in Louisiana. https://t.co/8jOb8Fgvkn  — CBS4Local (@CBS4Local) July 13, 2019  Tropical-storm-force winds will extend up to 175 miles outward from the storm’s center, which at 8 a.m. ET Saturday was still 50 miles west-southwest of Morgan City, Louisiana, forecasters said.  More than 62,000 customers across Louisiana were without power on Saturday morning, utility providers said. Hundreds of flights in New Orleans were canceled, and some cruise ship departures were in flux. The Real Danger is The Rain: Governor  Top of mind as Barry nears land is the heavy rains and related flooding expected to usher in.  “We are talking about 18-24 hours after landfall, the rain will still be coming down and will be the issue,” CNN Meteorologist Michael Guy said.  Gov. John Bel Edwards said some areas could see up to 25 inches of rain.  “Nobody should take this storm lightly just because it’s supposed to be a Category 1 (hurricane) when it makes landfall,” the governor said. “The real danger in this storm was never about the wind anyway, it’s always been about the rain, and that remains a very significant threat.”  When the ground is as saturated as it already is in the region, the governor said, the risks are endless. “It doesn’t take much wind to cause a tree to fall or a utility pole to fall,” he said. “These hazards are going to present themselves all over the state.”  Barry is nearing hurricane strength with winds of 70 mph. On Barry’s latest projection, it is expected to make landfall in about 3-5 hours just west of Marsh Island: https://t.co/Yf5ryCU4yX https://t.co/hAy5zBd6EK

In Morgan City, where the hurricane is expected to make landfall, officials and city workers are worried about lingering water. The fishing and oil hub is about 70 miles southwest of New Orleans and south of Lafayette.  With up to 30 inches of rain projected this weekend for the region, Mayor Frank “Boo” Grizzaffi worried it may be more than the city’s drainage system can take.  “We can handle the first 5 inches, but after that, we can pump 1 inch per hour. If we get rain greater than that, it will exceed our capacity to pump it out,” he told CNN.  Share this article

Eleven residents and two pets were evacuated from Isle de Jean Charles Saturday morning along with one resident experiencing a medical emergency in the Dulac area, a Coast Guard spokesperson said.  The Isle de Jean Charles residents were evacuated by Coast Guard helicopters and taken to the Houma-Terrebonne Airport. A response boat was dispatched from Morgan City but ultimately not used during the rescue operations.  Initial reports came in around 4:30 a.m. of people in distress along Island Road, the only way in and out of Isle de Jean Charles, a Coast Guard spokesperson said.  The Terrebonne Parish Sheriff’s Office initially planned to dispatch its Water Patrol but called the Coast Guard for assistance because weather conditions were too dangerous.  “We dispatched a Water Patrol agent so that a rescue by boat could be done,” Sheriff Jerry Larpenter said. “With the weather conditions at that time, particularly in darkness, the risk for that plan was too great both for deputies and for the people they would rescue.”  Initial reports stated five houses along the island were underwater, a Coast Guard spokesperson said.  Island Road remained entirely underwater Saturday. The area was included in a voluntary evacuation order issued by the parish.  As the storm continued to progress, Larpenter and Coast Guard Rear Adm. Paul Thomas urged residents to pay attention to local officials’ warning and take the storm seriously.  “We have a good working relationship with the Coast Guard, which makes this kind of cooperative effort possible,” Larpenter said.  “The longer someone waits the more the lives of their potential rescuers are put in danger, as well as their own,” Larpenter said. “I’m glad everybody ended up safe. But, this community’s residents are well aware that they are vulnerable to strong south winds, let alone a tropical system. Yet these individuals waited until the very last minute to call for help, rather than make plans to leave well before, when two Coast Guard helicopters and our boats would not have been necessary.”  With the medical emergency in Dulac, a 77-year-old man was evacuated by helicopter to the Houma airport and brought to an area hospital, Thomas said. He is now in stable condition, a Coast Guard spokesperson said.  “First, take this storm seriously. Our capabilities deteriorate as conditions deteriorate. Hang on and we’ll get there as soon as we can,” Thomas said from a news conference in New Orleans.  “Though we are the best, in some conditions its not safe to put air and boat crews in jeopardy,” he said. “As the storm moves north, we will come in from the south.”  If an emergency situation does arise, the best way to get help is by calling 911, Thomas said. Even calling the Coast Guard directly is not the best way to get emergency help.  While the storm made landfall Saturday afternoon, personnel were preparing for the long haul, he said.  About 20 aircraft crews and 30 boat teams are staged around south Louisiana ready to respond when needed. Many of those are the same response teams that moved in after Hurricane Harvey, Thomas said.

The US Coast Guard said that it had received notification regarding a disabled vessel with more than 20 people aboard, 130 miles northeast of Jacksonville, Florida.  “The crew of the Coast Guard Cutter Seneca was diverted to the scene and interdicted 22 Haitian migrants, 17 males, four females and one child, due to safety concerns with the vessel,” the Coast Guard said.  It said that last Saturday another notification was received indicating that a 24-foot wooden rustic vessel was found 27 miles south of Key West, Florida.  The Coast Guard said that 33 Cuban migrants including 27 males were detained as a result.  “The Coast Guard continues to maintain a focused and coordinated effort with multiple agency assets to interdict any attempt to dangerously and unlawfully immigrate by sea to the United States,” said Commander Michael Vega, Coast Guard 7th District enforcement branch.  “Those who are interdicted at sea attempting to illegally immigrate will be repatriated to their country in accordance with existing US immigration policy,” he added.  The US Coast Guard said about 3,027 Haitian migrants have attempted to illegally enter the US since the start of the year, compared to 2,727 Haitian migrants last year.  It also said 394 Cuban migrants have attempted to illegally enter the US as compared to 384 last year.  We want to hear from you!

COLLECT10123819070,COLLECT10123819070,key democrats press bill to increase minority recruitment at coast guard academy,GDELT18357157091562162444056.pdf,None,None,None,None,8991,"Published July 01. 2019 11:07PM | Updated July 02. 2019 6:58PM By Ana Radelat, Connecticut Mirror  Washington — Key House Democrats are backing a bill aimed at improving diversity at New London’s Coast Guard Academy, a move touched off by allegations of discrimination and a racially hostile environment at the school.  Introduced by Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., the “Coast Guard Academy Improvement Act,” would establish a commission that would make recommendations to foster “a more inclusive and supportive environment” at the academy.  The bill would require the academy to create a recruitment and retention plan for cadets, faculty and staff from diverse backgrounds, and permanently establish a minority outreach team.  The legislation would also require the academy to select up to 50 percent of each incoming class from a pool of candidates nominated by members of Congress.  The bill is sponsored by several Democrats besides Thompson, including Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., the head of the House Oversight and Reform Committee.  Thompson introduced a similar bill at the end of the last Congress. At that time, the Democratic congressman from Mississippi was in the minority and the bill did not advance. But in this Congress, Thompson is the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, which has jurisdiction over the Coast Guard.  “I am fully confident that if the Coast Guard Academy were to better represent the diverse fabric of this nation, the Coast Guard would only be stronger — and we would only be more secure,” Thompson said. “Accounts make it clear that diversity at the Academy is woefully inadequate, and furthermore, that cadets of diverse backgrounds have had to face racially hostile incidents.”  The academy did not respond Monday to a request for comment on the legislation.  The Coast Guard Academy has been under congressional scrutiny for more than a year by Thompson, Cummings, Rep. Joe Courtney, D-2nd District, and other Democratic lawmakers — including Sens. Richard Blumenthal and Chris Murphy. The congressional action was provoked by reports of discrimination at the academy and its poor grades on the “Equity Scorecard,” a study by the Center for Urban Education at the University of Southern California that tracks academic data, including graduation rates, by race, ethnicity and gender.  The Equity Scorecard reported that “black/African American cadets have been consistently less likely to graduate than the all-cadet average.”  The scorecard also said black cadets suffered from a disproportionately high share of disciplinary actions.  The lawmakers investigating the school asked the Coast Guard in June of 2018 for a number of documents. They had to set repeated deadlines for that information and for the release of additional documents.  “I must convey my frustration and disappointment that the Coast Guard and the Department of Homeland Security have stonewalled the efforts of this committee, along with the Committee on Oversight and Reform, to conduct oversight of the Coast Guard Academy,” Thompson told Coast Guard Commandant Admiral Karl Schultz during a Homeland Security Committee hearing on April 9.  Shortly after the hearing, the Coast Guard Academy turned over hundreds of pages of documents. But it is not clear whether the academy had responded in full to the lawmakers’ requests — or whether any of that information will be made public.  “Our investigation is ongoing,” said Adam Comis, spokesman for the House Homeland Security Committee.  In 2017, the Eclipse Legacy Fund Governance Committee, a group of academy alumni, wrote the then-superintendent of the Coast Guard, Admiral James Rendon, saying “the undeniable fact remains that the Coast Guard Academy doesn’t attract African American talent in large or consistent numbers that mirror the U.S. population.”  The committee said there were 66 African American cadets, and 22 others who declare 2 or more categories including African American in a cadet population of about 1053.  That means the composition of the cadet classes at the academy was little more than 6 percent, while the U.S. population at that time was about 12 percent black.  “Considering that the Coast Guard Academy remains the primary source of Coast Guard Officers by a nearly 3 to 1 ratio, the lack of African American cadets will translate to a lack of future Coast Guard Officers,” the alumni association wrote Rendon.  It requested information from the academy, including a list of all “implemented systemic changes that ensure sustained recruiting efforts” and the number of cadets divided by race, ethnicity, and gender who were offered appointments in the Coast Guard, the number who accepted appointments, and their retention rates since 2001.  Two years later, retired CDR Mark Harris said the Eclipse Legacy Fund Governance Committee has not received a response from the academy.
